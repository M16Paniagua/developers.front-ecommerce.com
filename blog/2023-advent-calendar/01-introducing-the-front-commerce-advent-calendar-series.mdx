We're happy to announce that we'll be sharing ctionable insights with

## Let’s dive in!

In these series, we’ll break down specific development tasks tackled in
Front-Commerce projects. We’ll compare how it was done in 2.x, and its
counterpart in the present, so we can all learn and grow together.

Over the years, we've gained valuable insight into how our product can better
serve our users. As we introduced new features and more projects and teams were
providing feedback, we noticed some recurring themes.

We recognize that developers are continually seeking ways to streamline their
workflow and improve their development process. That's what drove our vision for
the changes we brought in Front-Commerce Remixed.

## A series made for you!
