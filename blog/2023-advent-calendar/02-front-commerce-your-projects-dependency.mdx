Front-Commerce serves as an important npm dependency in your e-commerce project,
allowing you to update it as per your requirement. To ensure its seamless
operation, we suggest adopting the following upgrade approach: **semi-automated
for patch versions and scheduled (2-3 times a year) for minor versions.**

In todayâ€™s article, weâ€™ll explain why we switched from a single Git dependency
to several npm packages from a private registry.

This article is part of
[our Developer Guide series](./01-introducing-the-front-commerce-advent-calendar-series.mdx).
We're publishing new articles all year. **Stay tuned!**

:::

## 2.x: a single Git dependency

In a Front-Commerce 2.x project, the core is distributed as a single Git
dependency. To install or update it, use the following command:

```bash
npm install git+ssh://git@gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce.git#2.27.0
```

You get all the code, directly from our private Git repository. While this
approach may seem convenient and straightforward, it comes with some drawbacks:

- **SSH Access Setup:** Setting up SSH access to our private repository,
  including in your Docker development stack and CI environment, can be a source
  of misunderstanding and frustration for your team.
- **Unnecessary Code:** You receive all the code, even the portions you don't
  use, which can be confusing when browsing the codebase.
- **Unnecessary Dependencies:** You also get all the dependencies of modules you
  don't use, potentially leading to conflicts with your application dependencies
  and increasing the size of your `node_modules` and project folder.

This approach also has **direct engineering consequences** in the way the code
is designed and released.

For instance, we have to rely on our own patterns and conventions to expose a
public API.<br/> In 2.x, developers can use almost any internal module
(resolvers, factories, adaptersâ€¦). Even if an exported class or function was
designed for internal use in a first place, we have to be very careful about
breaking changes when we wanted to refactor it.

## 3.x: transition to a set of npm packages

In Front-Commerce 3.x, we have transitioned to a set of npm packages, which are
now published on a private GitLab registry. To install or update these packages,
use the following command:

```bash
npm install @front-commerce/core@3.1.1
```

### Authentication

Instead of using SSH, you can employ any
[private registry technique](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/#install-a-package)
to install the packages. For instance, you can use a `.npmrc` file:

```ini title="~/.npmrc"
//gitlab.blackswift.cloud/api/v4/projects/24/packages/npm/:_authToken=<your_gitlab_token>
@front-commerce:registry=https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/api/v4/projects/24/packages/npm/
```

:::tip Our recommendation

We recommend the use of a global `~/.npmrc` file for each developer, where you
can store an authentication token. This approach ensures that every
`@front-commerce/*` package will be installed from the private registry for
every project.

### Modularized Packages

The core has been restructured into several distinct packages, each serving a
specific purpose:

- **`@front-commerce/core`**: the fundamental elements of Front-Commerce,
  including the GraphQL API, React components, Configuration, Caching, and more,
  as known from 2.x.
- **`@front-commerce/remix`**: provides low-level adapters and public API for
  accessing `@front-commerce/core` features in a standard Remix project (_more
  details on this later this month ðŸ˜‰_)
- **`@front-commerce/compat`**: offers a compatibility layer that enables the
  use of 2.x features and removed APIs in a 3.x project, ensuring a seamless and
  progressive transition.
- **`@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine`**: serves as our base theme, featuring a
  fully-equipped storefront with a set of React components and styles to build
  upon.
- **All other packages are features, packaged as Front-Commerce Extensions.**
  These can be selectively chosen and combined based on your project's specific
  requirements. Examples include:
  - `@front-commerce/adobe-b2b`,
  - `@front-commerce/algolia`,
  - `@front-commerce/contentful`,
  - `@front-commerce/magento2`,
  - `@front-commerce/paypal`,
  - etc.

**All packages are versioned in unison** and align with our Front-Commerce
versioning.<br/> We decided to bump the version number for every release, even
in the absence of change in the package. This approach facilitates easy
identification of the Front-Commerce version used in your project and simplifies
communication about it.

Similar to the process in 2.x, you can update all `@front-commerce/*` packages
simultaneously.

### Advantages

This new approach offers several benefits:

- **It matches the way you work** with other dependencies in your projects.
- **Package exports are explicit**, exposing only what is intended for external
  use. This clarity makes it easier to discover what's here for you to use and
  enables us to provide better backward compatibility guarantees.
- You will install only the necessary components, **avoiding unnecessary
  bloat**.

To illustrate this last point, let's compare the size of a Front-Commerce 2.x
`node_modules` folder with a 3.x one, on our Magento2 demo project:

- Front-Commerce 2.x: **1.3 GB**
- Front-Commerce 3.x: **321 MB** ðŸŽ‰

We hope you'll enjoy this new approach as much as we do! We eagerly await your
feedback.
