In today's article, we'll compare how dynamic page implementation differs
between Front-Commerce 2.x and Front-Commerce 3.x.

A dynamic page is generated on the fly when a user requests it, rather than
being statically generated at build time. This is particularly useful for pages
that rely on external data, such as product pages, category pages, or search
pages. For this article, we are going to use an FAQ Article detail as an
example.

This article aims to shed light on one of the most significant changes we've
made in Front-Commerce 3.x, making it easier for you to understand.

## 2.x: file-based routing, Enhancers and Page components

In Front-Commerce 2.x, dynamic pages were implemented using core components from
Front-Commerce.

This included **file-based routing**, which was implemented by Front-Commerce
itself on top of React Router. This allowed developers to map the rendered
component to a specific URL by creating a file in the `web/theme/routes/`.

```jsx title="web/theme/routes/faq/[slug].js"
// The route file was almost empty and only used to declare the Page component
import FaqDetails from "theme/pages/FaqDetails";

export default FaqDetails;
```

The **Page component** was responsible for fetching data from the GraphQL API
and rendering the page once all the required data was available.

```jsx title="web/theme/pages/FaqDetails.js"
import React from "react";
import Link from "theme/components/atoms/Typography/Link";
import EnhanceFaqDetails from "./EnhanceFaqDetails";
import { H1 } from "theme/components/atoms/Typography/Heading";
import VoteWidget from "theme/modules/Faq/VoteWidget";
import Wysiwyg from "theme/modules/WysiwygV2";

const FaqDetails = (props) => {
  const slug = props.match.params.slug;

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div>
        <Link to="/faq">⬅️ Back to list</Link>
        <br />
        Slug: {slug}
      </div>
      {props.loading && <p>Loading…</p>}
      {props.faqEntry && (
        <div>
          <H1>{props.faqEntry.question}</H1>
          <Wysiwyg content={props.faqEntry.answer} />

          <VoteWidget faqEntry={props.faqEntry} />
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default EnhanceFaqDetails(FaqDetails);
```

Pages delegated the fetching of data to **Enhancers**
(<abbr title="Higher-Order Components">HOCs</abbr>), which were responsible for
retrieving data from the GraphQL API and handling rendering states before
feeding it to the Page component.

```jsx title="web/theme/pages/EnhanceFaqDetails.js"
// The Enhancer was responsible for fetching data and handling rendering states
import graphqlWithPreload from "web/core/apollo/graphqlWithPreload";
import compose from "recompose/compose";
import FaqDetailsQuery from "./FaqDetailsQuery.gql";
import withEntityNotFound from "theme/modules/PageError/NotFound/withEntityNotFound";

export default compose(
  graphqlWithPreload(FaqDetailsQuery, {
    options: (props) => ({
      variables: {
        slug: props.match.params.slug,
      },
    }),
    preloadOptions: (args) => ({
      variables: {
        slug: args.match.params.slug,
      },
    }),
    props: ({ data }) => ({
      loading: data.loading,
      error: !data.loading && data.error,
      faqEntry: !data.loading && data.faqGetBySlug,
    }),
  }),
  // It could also be combined with other Enhancers
  // such as Loadable for a full page loading state
  // Loadable((props) => !props.loading, LoadingComponent),
  withEntityNotFound({
    isFound: (props) => props.loading || props.faqEntry,
  })
);
```

Enhancers HOCs had several responsibilities and could combine different HOCs
from Front-Commerce to achieve the desired result.

For instance, they could combine `graphqlWithPreload` for fetching data with
preloading, `withEntityNotFound` and `Loadable` for handling different rendering
states. User restricted pages could leverage `checkAuth` for checking user
authentication and redirecting to the login page if necessary.

## Plain Remix routes in 3.x!

In Front-Commerce 3.x, dynamic pages are implemented using a different approach:
we've replaced our custom file-based routing with
[Remix routes](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/routes).

Remix routes now have more responsibilities than 2.x routes. They export a
`loader` function that is responsible for fetching data from the GraphQL API and
passing it to the Page component (main export of the route).

Route loaders can also be used to handle errors (with the `ErrorBoundary`
export), redirections (with the `redirect` response) and many other checks.
**Routes code is usually simpler to reason about than Enhancers**, with less
indirections.

Here is an example of a route that fetches a question from the GraphQL API and
renders it using a `<FaqDetail />` Page component (that is a plain React
component). As you can see, all the logic belongs to the route!

```tsx title="app/routes/_main.faq.$slug.tsx"
// The route is now a .tsx file, which allows us to use TypeScript and JSX syntax.

import { json } from "@front-commerce/remix/node";
import { useLoaderData } from "@front-commerce/remix/react";
import type { LoaderFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import FaqDetail from "theme/pages/FaqDetail";
import { isRouteErrorResponse, useRouteError } from "@remix-run/react";
import { FaqDetailDocument } from "~/graphql/graphql";
import { FrontCommerceApp } from "@front-commerce/remix";

// The route exports a `loader` function that is responsible
// for fetching data and throwing errors, ensuring that
// the main component is only rendered in the "happy path".
export const loader = async ({ context, params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const { slug } = params;

  // The `loader` uses the `FrontCommerceApp` class to access the Front-Commerce
  // core from Remix. In this example, we use it to fetch data from the GraphQL
  // unified API (similar to the one you're used to).
  const app = new FrontCommerceApp(context.frontCommerce);
  const response = await app.graphql.query(FaqDetailDocument, { slug });
  if (!response.faqEntry) {
    throw new Response("Question not found", { status: 404 });
  }

  return json({
    question: response.faqEntry,
  });
};

// The main component is a plain React component that receives
// the data from the loader, using Remix fetching primitives (`useLoaderData`)
// both on the server and on the client.
export default () => {
  const { question } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();

  return <FaqDetail question={question} />;
};

// The route also exports an ErrorBoundary component that is responsible
// for displaying errors. It can be used to display a custom error page.
export const ErrorBoundary = () => {
  const error = useRouteError();

  if (isRouteErrorResponse(error)) {
    return <div>FAQ : question not found</div>;
  }
};
```

## Conclusion

We hope this article helped you understand how dynamic pages are implemented in
Front-Commerce 2.x and 3.x.

Here is a table comparing the different concepts between 2.x and 3.x:

| Concept         | Front-Commerce 2.x           | Front-Commerce 3.x                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Page components | Plain React components (JSX) | Plain React components (JSX/TSX)           |
| Routes          | Custom file-based routing    | Remix routes                               |
| Data fetching   | Enhancers HOCs with Apollo   | `loader` functions with `FrontCommerceApp` |
| Error Handling  | Enhancers HOCs               | `ErrorBoundary` component                  |

We've made several changes to make it easier for you to build your projects. You
can now use Remix routes in a natural way, while still leveraging the power of
Front-Commerce with a cleaner separation of concerns.
