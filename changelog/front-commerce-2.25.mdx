exciting updates that will brighten up your e-commerce experience.

In this release, we introduce the Magic Button™, empowering content contributors
like never before. Get ready to elevate visual experiences with the new Focal
Point for Images feature. Enjoy enhanced sorting and facets behaviour in
ElasticSearch-driven PLPs, and simplify online payments for Negotiable quotes

## Empowering content contribution with the Magic Button™

Managing content in a composable architecture comes with its own set of
challenges. To address these challenges, we're excited to introduce the Magic
Button in Front-Commerce 2.25. This feature expands the scope of a headless
storefront by **bringing content contributors and stakeholders back into the
equation.**

With Front-Commerce, developers can now enhance the contribution experience and
make it more efficient. When Contribution Mode is enabled, the Magic Button
appears, providing access to an Editorial Toolbox with a range of powerful
features.

**Preview Mode:** Get a sneak peek of upcoming content versions on your
storefront before publishing them in your CMS (for platforms that support this
functionality). Ensure content accuracy and consistency before it goes public.

**Auto-refresh:** Experience real-time updates of all the data on the screen
without the need for manual reloading. Stay up to date with the latest changes
effortlessly.

**X-Ray:** Easily identify the system responsible for underlying data by adding
visual outlines around UI components. With a single click, swiftly access the
management page for faster backend navigation. Streamline your workflow and save
time.

We've worked diligently to ensure that the Magic Button has no impact on the
end-user experience or application performance. We've created API primitives,
such as components and GraphQL directives, to support these features and make
implementation seamless.

Additionally, we've updated our default themes and connectors to enhance the
contribution experience when using Magento1/OpenMage LTS, Magento2/Adobe
Commerce, and Contentful.

Please [refer to our documentation](/docs/2.x/category/magic-button) to learn
more about the Magic Button and how to implement its features in your projects.

## Focal Point: craft better visual experiences with Focal Point for images

Front-Commerce 2.25 introduces a new feature that elevates the visual impact of
your storefront – the "Focal Point" for images. The **`<Image />`** component
and our existing adapters allow you to implement responsive images, serving
optimized versions based on the user's device and layout.

Previously, developers had no control over which part of the image remained
visible when visual space was limited. With the new **`focalPoint`** property in
the **`<Image />`** component, **you can now specify the focal point coordinates
(x/y) to crop the image around that point**. This ensures that the most
important elements of the image remain visible, regardless of the device.

The best part? You can start using this feature right away. We've added
compatibility with all our current image adapters. Our default media proxy,
along with Cloudinary, TwicPics, and Akamai Image Manager, fully supports the
**`focalPoint`** functionality.

## ElasticSearch: better default sorting and a new facets behaviour

In this release, we've dedicated efforts to enhance the user experience of
ElasticSearch-driven Product Listing Pages (PLPs). We've made significant
improvements in two crucial areas: sorting and facets behaviour.

With the introduction of the new **`refinementsFacetsOnly`** feature flag, you
have more control over how facets are displayed to users. The historical
faceting behaviour, where only facets matching the existing selection were
returned, allowed users to refine their selection incrementally. However, this
required removing filters to select new options.<br />_Example: if users select
“Brand = Adidas”, they will have to remove this filter in order to select “Brand
= Puma”._

By turning off the **`refinementsFacetsOnly`** feature flag, the ElasticSearch
module now returns facet values in a"smarter" way. Users can expand their
current selection with new options for a facet without the need to remove
existing filters. This allows for a more seamless and intuitive browsing
experience, enabling users to explore a wider range of products.<br />_Example:
if users select “Brand = Adidas”, they’ll now continue to see other brands as
soon as they have products matching the other selected filters (e.g.: price
range, size, colour, etc…)_

Another feature supported in this version is to **use facet labels as values in
URLs**. This is an opt-in feature that can be enabled with the
`useAttributeLabels` search configuration. It doesn’t require any code change,
but be careful as it leads to changes in URLs!

In addition to the facets improvements, we've also made enhancements to default
sorting in ElasticSearch-driven PLPs. When no user-defined sorting criteria are
specified, **products are now sorted based on the position defined by
merchants** in Magento. This default sorting behaviour ensures a consistent and
merchant-centric product presentation.

## Adobe B2B: Online payments for Negotiable quotes (with Stripe)

Introduced in [Front-Commerce 2.23](/changelog/front-commerce-2.23), Negotiable
quotes could only be purchased using "offline" payment methods, such as payment
on account or bank transfer.

However, we understand the importance of providing convenient online payment
options to streamline the purchasing process.

With this release, we've improved the Negotiable checkout to support
Front-Commerce payment methods. Now, customers can pay for negotiated quotes
online using our Stripe payment module. This integration with Stripe offers a
secure and efficient payment experience, eliminating the need for manual payment
processing.

Head over to
[our Stripe documentation](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/stripe#adobe-commerce-b2b)
to learn how to enable this feature.

  datasources
