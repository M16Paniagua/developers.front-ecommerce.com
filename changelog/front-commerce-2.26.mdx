## Authorize.net Support for Magento 1, Improved Redis performance, Configurable `axios` timeout and Payment Log Security

Summer is here, and we know that many of you are enjoying well-deserved
holidays. That's why we're keeping things light and breezy with Front-Commerce
2.26, a small release packed with essential improvements to enhance your
eCommerce experience.

As mentioned in our [2.25 release announcement](/changelog/front-commerce-2.25),
**our focus during the next months is on remixing Front-Commerce**. This means
that new features will be kept to a minimum, but rest assured, we're still
committed to delivering quality updates that make a difference.

Let's take a look at what's new in Front-Commerce 2.26â€¦

### Authorize.net Support for Magento 1

Front-Commerce 2.26 now supports Magento 1's native Authorize.net payment method
for headless payments. This integration allows for seamless and secure payment
processing through the Authorize.net payment gateway within the usual
Front-Commerce checkout flow.

Read more about this integration on our
[Authorize.net documentation page](/docs/2.x/advanced/payments/authorize-net).

### Improved Redis performance: Preventing Heavy Cache Invalidations from Impacting Normal Operations

In this release, we've introduced a performance improvement to prevent heavy
cache invalidations from impacting normal operations. This performance patch is
also available in patch releases **for every supported version!**

We noticed instances of slowness on some projects heavily using Redis _(70+
calls per page)_ when cache invalidations were performed intensively _(1700
simultaneous `SCAN` operations on 3 million keys)_. Despite having a fully
scalable and responsive Redis setup, the bottleneck was the Redis client
instance shared between the invalidation mechanism and the DataLoader.

To overcome this challenge, we've implemented a solution that exposes a
different Redis client to the application than the one used in the DataLoader.
This ensures that heavy cache invalidations no longer impact the overall
performance of your Front-Commerce application.

We've thoroughly tested this solution and beta tested it in production on an
impacted project. We're confident that it will benefit every project and
encourage you to **give it a try, by updating to the latest patch version of
your currently used Front-Commerce version**.

### Configurable `axios` timeout

In this release, we've added an often requested feature: configurable `axios`
timeout. With Front-Commerce 2.26, you now have the ability to set custom
timeout values for `axios` requests for each specific services.

This empowers you to optimize the reliability of your application, ensuring a
smooth and responsive experience for your users, or dealing with slower staging
websites.

Read
[our migration guide](/docs/2.x/appendices/migration-guides/#configurable-axios-timeouts)
for details about the new environment variables available.

### Enhanced Payment Log Security: Redacting Sensitive Information

At Front-Commerce, we prioritize the security of your eCommerce platform. In
Front-Commerce 2.26, we've introduced a new feature that **automatically redacts
sensitive information from payment logs**, providing an extra layer of
protection for your customers' data.

We want to assure you that we haven't encountered any instances of existing
modules logging sensitive information. However, we believe in being proactive
when it comes to security. By implementing this feature, we ensure that your
customers' payment or personal data remains safeguarded, even in the rare event
of a payment module inadvertently logging sensitive information.

  <summary><h3 className="mb-0">Performance Improvements</h3></summary>
```

- **redis:** we've increased the `SCAN` `COUNT` iterations number during cache
  invalidation from 100 to 1000 and made it configurable using
  `invalidationScanIterationSize` (see
  [Merge Request](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/merge_requests/2243)
  for details)

```

- **magento1:** it is now possible to use the `PerMagentoCustomerTaxZone`
  caching strategy to cache prices per tax zone (similar to how it works for
  Magento 2)
- **magento1:** the payment payload is now propagated to `/place-order` API
  calls so payment methods can use it also in the related Magento observers
- **magento2:** it is now possible to use a _temporary_ address during checkout.
  This address won't be saved to the customer's address book
