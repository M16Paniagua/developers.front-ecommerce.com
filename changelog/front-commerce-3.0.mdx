We are excited to introduce **Front-Commerce 3.0**, a big leap forward in
e-commerce development. With a focus on web performance, developer experience,
and adherence to web standards, this release is set to redefine how you approach
building your online storefronts.

**Front-Commerce** is a storefront for headless commerce based on the
[newly released **Remix v2** framework](https://remix.run/blog/remix-v2). We're
bringing all the goodness we developed over the past 7 years, to the Remix
ecosystem.

Let's examine how we've merged both technologies to enhance the experience for
end users and developers alike.

## ðŸ’Œ A team and community effort

As we embark on the exciting journey of this new major product release, I can't
help but feel a deep sense of gratitude. A lot happened since
[we announced that we were Remixing Front-Commerce 6 months ago](/changelog/front-commerce-is-getting-a-remix)
and we want to say a few words to our community.

First and foremost, a heartfelt thanks goes out to our incredible team who
poured their passion, creativity, and countless hours into bringing this vision
to life. Without their dedication, none of this would have been possible.

To our invaluable integrators (agencies, developers, project managersâ€¦), who
have been providing feedback over the years and kept interacting with us while
we were busy with this new version: your understanding and collaboration mean
the world to us, and we can't wait for you to experience the magic of a
Front-Commerce Remixed! **We've built it for you!**

And for merchants trusting Front-Commerce, we genuinely thank you for your
patience as we focused on v3 development over summer features. We're eagerly
anticipating how this new release will enhance your business.

Together, we've created something special: let's dive into what this release
holds and how it will positively impact all of you. â˜•

## Web Performance Improvement

We're all working together to create user experiences that convert, fast! Let's
take a moment to explore the improvements that will lead to faster page load
times and enhanced user experiences.

### Reduced Client-side Dependencies

With the introduction of Front-Commerce 3.0, we've made significant strides in
reducing client-side dependencies. We've removed libraries like Apollo Client,
GraphQL, GraphQL-tag, Formsy, and RxJS, replacing them with Remix default data
fetching and primitives.

This translates to **less JavaScript shipped to users**, ensuring that your
application is faster to interact with, particularly on mobile and low-end
devices.

**We could achieve this thanks to a major shift in the way data flows in
Front-Commerce**: instead of using GraphQL over HTTP (2.x), Front-Commerce now
uses GraphQL server-side and uses Remix's default fetching patterns (`loaders` /
`actions` / `fetchers`) for client-server interactions. Read
[Server vs. Client Code Execution (Remix doc)](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/server-vs-client)
to learn about this.

### Streaming Responses to Users

This new version improves how content is delivered to your users. Unlike
previous versions where the entire page had to be generated before content was
sent, **Front-Commerce now streams content as it gets generated** during <abbr
title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr>.

This means that browsers start downloading content earlier, resulting in
improved page load times. It's not just about today; it's about preparing for
the future. Streaming responses open the door for more advanced patterns,
leveraging React's features to enhance user experiences.

### Embracing Remix Tooling

Front-Commerce now embraces the power of Remix. These new foundations allowed us
to update our bundling tooling. New tools offer **better performance** for both
developer experience and deployment times, resulting in smoother workflows and
quicker feedback loops.

It also improves the perceived performance of your storefront. Without going
into too much detail, Front-Commerce 3.0 is better to load content precisely
when needed, minimizing unnecessary payload sent _over the network_.

### Removal of Unused CSS Code

Front-Commerce supports a wide range of features, that's why you love it! And
each feature has its own styling. In Front-Commerce 2.x, while unused JavaScript
was never loaded, unused CSS for features often made its way to end-users.

Front-Commerce 3.0 addresses this by ensuring that **CSS for unused features is
never loaded** by the end-user. We've optimized our approach by importing CSS
styles in each React component, reducing bloat and improving performance.

## Developer Experience Improvements

Front-Commerce 3.0 not only enhances web performance but also elevates your
development experience.

- **TypeScript:** We've added first-class support for TypeScript in
  Front-Commerce, both on the server and client. TypeScript is a natural
  extension to the GraphQL types you've grown accustomed to. This enables more
  robust and intuitive development, providing a better development experience
  with improved discoverability and a reduced cognitive load.
- **Faster Tooling:** Leveraging esbuild, we've significantly accelerated
  feedback loops, making it easier to stay in the development flow. We also
  adopted `pnpm` internally to develop the Front-Commerce core, and we encourage
  you to adopt it too!
- **Better Front-Commerce APIs:** We've revamped critical parts of how
  integrators interact with Front-Commerce, including an Extension API, new CLI
  commands, clearer packages with a smaller API surface, and aligning with
  modern coding practices _(the next generation of FC's developers may not see a
  HOC anymore ðŸ˜ƒ)_.

Don't worry: we haven't changed most of the things you've get used to do every
day when working with Front-Commerce. **You can still override frontend
components, override GraphQL resolvers, extend the GraphQL schema, cache remote
API data, configure your application in many ways, and more!**

Plus, we've introduced **Codemods** for seamless migration from 2.x to 3.x,
ensuring that your transition is smooth and cost-effective. Good news: Codemods
are here to stay, and will also serve your minor versions upgrades!

## Web Standards

At the core of Front-Commerce is a commitment to web standards. Using standard
**[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Request) /
[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Response) objects** for
web server interactions ensures interoperability, a familiar developer
experience, and paves the way for open innovation like edge computing.

### Standard Forms, to create more accessible storefronts

Using GraphQL on the client is great, but it always prevented us to use a _good
old `<form method="POST" action="/cart/items">`_ and progressively enhance the
user experience. With GraphQL on the server, this is no longer a blocker.

Front-Commerce now embraces modern web standards for forms, improving code
accessibility and sustainability. We've replaced `formsy-react` with Remix
`<Form>` component, aligned with standard form-related objects, and simplified
the developer experience.

We'll gradually ensure that every user interaction can _work without Javascript_
as we refactor the theme for Progressive Enhancement.

### CSS vs. Sass

This release marks a first shift towards using CSS features over Sass, reducing
our dependency on Sass. As the CSS standard continues to evolve, we're prepared
to explore new theming possibilities in the coming years.

We've decided to go step-by-step, and in this new major Front-Commerce version
we've replaced the use of Sass variables with CSS variables.

### Progressive Enhancement (PE)

Progressive Enhancement will be at the heart of all Front-Commerce 3.x version
onwards. We aim to deliver fast and enjoyable storefronts for all users, no
matter their circumstances. Leveraging Remix features like routes, loaders, and
actions, Front-Commerce is primed for progressive enhancement.

In the future, storefronts could even be turned into **Multiple Page
Applications** without JavaScriptâ€¦ who knows!
_[(View Transitions API is an awesome web standard and people are building awesome things with it today)](https://astro-records.pages.dev/)_

### A standard technical stack for futureproof projects

Front-Commerce has always adhered to modern tech standards, adopting them
because they were futureproof â€¦ not because they were trendy. We've adopted
React, Node, GraphQL, and the Web Platform and have always tried to build on top
of them with the best practices in mind.

**Developing with Front-Commerce should feel like working with these
technologies outside of Front-Commerce**. That's how agencies can recruit new
developers to join their team and be quickly efficient on Front-Commerce
projects. That's how we can guarantee that projects developed with
Front-Commerce will be futureproof and could evolve, no matter where our
industry is headed in the future.

This year, AI and LLMs changed a lot of things in the way everyone works and
interacts online. The relationship between standard technologies and AI-assisted
development workflows might not be very clear at a first glance, but we're
excited to incorporate this into your experience around Front-Commerce â€¦ but
that's another story.

## Welcome to v3

If you're still reading, you must have plenty of questions about the next steps
for you.

We can't address everything in one blog post, but we're happy to help you out!

Some highlights:

- in the next weeks, we'll keep publishing concrete content to zoom in on new
  Front-Commerce concepts so you'll keep learning more about this. Follow us!
- we recommend that new Front-Commerce projects start with 3.0
- migrating a 2.x project to 3.x is not only possible but we expect you to start
  planning this transition. Our `@front-commerce/compat` package is dedicated to
  this use case, so you can start migrating right away and refactor your
  codebase progressively. The best thing is to <ContactLink>discuss it with
  us</ContactLink>. For your information, the first project starts its migration
  on Monday!
- we will continue to ship new versions of Front-Commerce 2.x, but don't expect
  major features on this branch by default
- we still expect some performance improvements and stabilization work in the
  next few weeks and we'll merge this work with new features in 3.1 (in 6 weeks)

Follow us closely during the next weeks for more announcements and details about
this new Front-Commerce version.
