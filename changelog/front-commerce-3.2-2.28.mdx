## New packages, a Magic Button revamp, Attraqt recommendations and cloud improvements!

Happy New Year, everyone! We hope you had a great holiday season and are ready
to start the new year with a bang.

We are excited to introduce a range of new features and enhancements to
Front-Commerce's core. While we are still prioritizing core fixes and
stabilization, **we have also been able to ship some significant features to
Front-Commerce Remixed**: all Magento 1 modules, Adyen Payment, and Akamai Image
Manager are now available as standalone packages under the `@front-commerce/***`
namespace.

We have also **revamped the technical foundations of the Magic Button** and
introduced a new concept called **server services** in Front-Commerce 3.2.

The `2.x` branch also received some love with the introduction of **Attraqt
personalized recommendations** and a few bug fixes. **Be sure to upgrade to
Front-Commerce 2.28!** As time progresses, we anticipate more projects
transitioning to `3.x`, and the number of new features released for both major
versions will gradually decrease.

Let's dive in and explore what's new in Front-Commerce, and for Front-Commerce
Cloud customers.

## Improvements to Front-Commerce Remixed

The following features and enhancements are available in Front-Commerce 3.2
only. They're direct improvements to Front-Commerce 3.x, and new features for
projects using our Remix version.

### New extensions for Front-Commerce Remixed

With a stable foundation in place, we're now able to focus on Remixing the
remaining core Front-Commerce extensions.

This release includes the following features:

- all Magento1 modules are now available in the `@front-commerce/magento1`
  package. Follow the
  [Magento1 extension's documentation](/docs/3.x/extensions/magento1/) to learn
  how to use it.
- Adyen payment integration is also available in the `@front-commerce/adyen`
  package
- Akamai Image Manager integration is available in the
  `@front-commerce/akamai-image-manager` package

### Contribution mode and Magic Button

[Six months ago, we introduced the Magic Button](/changelog/front-commerce-2.25#empowering-content-contribution-with-the-magic-button).
A feature that improves the contribution experience and makes content editing
more efficient.

With Front-Commerce 3.x, we've revamped the technical foundations of the Magic
Button to embrace Web standards and improve how it works. This new version is
now available in Front-Commerce 3.2.

It means that all supported extensions (Magento2, Contentful…) now have full
feature-parity with Front-Commerce 2.x when it comes to identifying storefront
content, previewing unpublished content, auto-refresh etc.

### Server Services (unstable API)

On a technical level, we've also introduced a new concept: **Server Services**.

**Why?** Until now, several Front-Commerce core features provided a way to
register some custom logic using loaders. Examples:

- `loaders.Sitemap.registerNodesFetcher`
- `loaders.Page.registerUrlMatcher`
- `loaders.ContentMetadataExtractorRegistry.register`

It forced developers to manually create loaders when wanting to use these
features outside of a GraphQL context, such as in an express middleware.

**What?** Server Services is our proposal for relocating such responsibilities
outside of "loaders" so that GraphQL loaders remain responsible only for
fetching data from remote sources.

**How?** We've introduced a lifecycle hook API that allows developers to
register custom logic into core Services. Core Services are injected more
globally, and can be used in GraphQL (context enhancers, loaders, resolvers) but
also in the application's routes as they're part of the `FrontCommerceApp`
object.

You can read
[the current API design in our documentation](/docs/3.x/api-reference/front-commerce-core/defineExtension#unstable_lifecyclehooks).
We'd love to hear your feedbacks on this, **please let us know how you feel
about this!**

## New features available for every project

The following features and enhancements are available in both Front-Commerce 3.2
and 2.28. Update to the version relevant to your project to take advantage of
these features.

### Attraqt: personalized recommendations

When it comes to e-commerce, personalization is key. It's a proven way to
increase conversion rates and average order value. That's why we're excited to
announce that Front-Commerce now supports Attraqt personalization.

You can now use Attraqt to display personalized product recommendations on your
Front-Commerce storefront. No matter how you use Attraqt on the front-end
(contact your Attraqt representative to find the best way for your use case), as
soon as you have the user profile ID, you can use it to display
[personalized recommendations](https://attraqt.gitbook.io/developer-documentation/xo-recommendations/using-the-recommendations-api#personalised-recommendation).

The Attraqt recommendations loader
[now accepts an optional `profileId` parameter](/docs/2.x/magento2/search-engine#attraqt-recommendations-usage-example)
that can be used to display personalized recommendations.

### Bug Fixes

- **adyen:** when using the Magento2 module, the `amount` (and `countryCode`)
  are now properly passed to Apple Pay
- **twicpics:** the aspect ratio is now properly computed whenever using the
  `twicpics` image adapter
- **ui**: the `<ProductListSlider />` component is now more resilient to
  incorrect data passed, and can display an empty component instead of crashing

## Front-Commerce Cloud got an upgrade

We've upgraded our Front-Commerce Cloud infrastructure during the end of the
year. Without entering into too much technical detail, **you should expect
better performance and better stability for your Front-Commerce Cloud
projects.** You may already have noticed it!

This upgrade contains several improvements **consolidating our experience with
Front-Commerce Cloud projects over the years**. These changes have been rolled
out progressively during the last weeks, without noticeable downtime for your
projects.

We rolled out improvements to how Front-Commerce projects are deployed and
managed:

- we are now able to handle unexpected huge traffic spikes more efficiently with
  a specific "operation" mode that can be enabled within minutes
- [we now support the Stale-While-Revalidate HTTP cache strategy](https://web.dev/articles/stale-while-revalidate?hl=fr),
  for instant page loads
- we've improved the way staging and production environments are handled, to
  reduce the risk of side effects while maintaining a high level of similarity
  between environments
- we also introduced a future-proof DNS configuration for every project, to ease
  any future transitions

These changes also enable other improvements you'll see very soon. For example,
you'll be autonomous when it comes to flushing the HTTP cache of your project,
for a specific URL a directory or the whole project. This will be useful to
quickly flush the cache after a content update.
