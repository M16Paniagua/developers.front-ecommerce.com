## Introducing Event-Driven Architectural Components, Extensions Features, Public Configurations, and Automatic session commit

We are pleased to announce the release of Front-Commerce 3.3, which lays the
technical foundations for exciting features to come in the future. While the
full set of features will be unveiled in 3.4, this release is packed with new
architectural components that enable you to develop event-based features in your
applications today.

In addition to the usual bug fixes, we have enhanced the core to improve your
overall experience and prevent common mistakes detected from projects already
using Front-Commerce Remixed. Finally, we have introduced several smaller but
convenient features listed in the "Other changes" section below.

Let's dive in and explore what's new in this Front-Commerce release.

## Infrastructure for Event-Driven use cases

We are pleased to introduce dedicated architectural components tailored for
event-driven use cases.

Front-Commerce can now dispatch **server-side events for business-critical
actions**, such as order placement, and you can register specific integrations
to react to these events. This enables you to build event-driven workflows, such
as **sending a notification when an order is placed**, or any other custom
action you can think of.

This opens the door to a wide range of use cases, including some that we have
already identified and are working on. **We are excited to see what you will
create with these new capabilities!**

Here's a high-level overview of how these new features fit into an existing
Front-Commerce application:
![Front-Commerce Server-side events](./assets/3.3-sse.png)

Technically, the key components of this release include:

- A `ServerEventBus` service for dispatching server-side events from your
  Front-Commerce application
- A Redis Stream event handler implementation allowing to centralize and process
  server-side events in a unified, scalable and reliable way
- A new `front-commerce worker` CLI command to run dedicated event workers
  processing server-side events with registered integrations
- An Integration API allowing to register runtime integrations to react to
  server-side events and notify external systems
- This release includes a single default integration allowing to notify remote
  webhooks _(stay tuned for more integrations in future releases ðŸš€)_

We have implemented a first use case to demonstrate the potential of these new
features. We have introduced an `OrderPlaced` event dispatched whenever an order
is placed.

**Front-Commerce Cloud projects can use this right away!** We already have all
the required infrastructure in place to support this feature out of the box in
your project. Please contact us if you want to enable this feature for your
project.

To delve deeper into these updates, we encourage you to explore
[our dedicated documentation about Server-Side Events](/docs/3.x/concepts/server-side-events).<br />
If you have specific use cases that could benefit from these enhancements, we
would love to receive your feeback as we continue to refine and expand our
offerings.

## Feature flags in extensions

We have added new options to the extensions for our supported eCommerce
platforms. When registering the extension, you can now select the features you
want to use.

A common use case would be to replace Magento CMS with Contentful, or run an
Adobe B2B store without Negotiable quotes. In Front-Commerce 3.3, **you can now
register these extensions with deactivated features, which will remove any
related GraphQL schema, configurations, or Remix routes.**

Please read more about it in each extension's installation documentation:

- [Magento1](/docs/3.x/extensions/magento1/#feature-flags)
- [Magento2](/docs/3.x/extensions/magento2/#feature-flags)
- [Adobe B2B](/docs/3.x/extensions/adobe-b2b/#feature-flags)

As always, please let us know if you identify any use cases in other extensions
that could benefit from this feature.

## Public configurations

Public configurations are configurations that are exposed to the client. They
are used in client-side code to configure the application or load remote
resources.

Bid farewell to the specific environment variables prefixed with
`FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_`. Public configurations are now using the unified
configuration you already know. All configurations available under the
`config.public` namespace are exposed to the client. One direct benefit of this
change is that **you can update these configurations without having to rebuild
your application.**

You can define public configurations using configuration providers, just as you
are used to doing for server-side configurations. To use them in your
client-side code, we introduced a new `usePublicConfig()` hook and a
`getPublicConfig()` function (when you're not in a React component).

We took this as an opportunity to simplify our existing codebase by exposing
`shop` information link any other public configuration.

We updated our theme to replace the deprecated `withShop` with the new
`withPublicConfig` HOC. **We have also exposed all `FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_xxx`
environment variables in the `config.compatEnv` to facilitate a progressive
migration** and introduced a codemod to help you migrate your codebase so you'll
be able to use the new public configurations without any manual work! ðŸŽ‰

## Automatic session commit

Until now, Front-Commerce was following Remix's best practices for session
management.
[As per Remix's recommendation](https://remix.run/docs/en/2.6.0/utils/sessions),
developers had to manually commit the session and define the `Set-Cookie` header
in their routes responses.

Based on our experience from supporting customers working on Front-Commerce 3.x,
we noticed that this manual process was error-prone and was often forgotten.
This could lead to unexpected behaviors and bugs in the application.

**We are pleased to announce that Front-Commerce now automatically commits the
session to the server when needed.** This means that you no longer need to
manually commit the user session in your routes. The `Set-Cookie` header will be
automatically added to the response whenever the user session is modified.

We've simplified our codebase and have implemented a codemod to help you adapt
yours by removing redundant `Set-Cookie` headers from your routes too. We hope
this change will make your development experience smoother and make your
applications more reliable!

- **Server:** we added a new `/__front-commerce/health` endpoint, serving as a
  healthcheck. It can be used in cloud environments to ensure the application
  readiness.
- **Server:** we introduced a new endpoint `/__front-commerce/metrics` for
  metrics tracking. This endpoint integrates with Prometheus to provide valuable
  insights into the application's performance and usage metrics.
- **Magento2:** the inject role endpoint now supports body based token for
  `no-cors` context
- **Theme:** the search results page is now available on its dedicated route
- **Theme:** an error is now thrown if a payment method isn't registered in
  payment flow, to ensure explicit configuration and avoid silent failures
- **Compat:** the FormV2 compat directory structure now mimics the directory
  structure of an usual theme
- **DX:** a new `front-commerce migrate` CLI script now allows to run codemods
  on a project in a more streamlined way
- **DX:** the `__front-commerce/debug` route now requires a security token in
  the URL for staging websites to prevent exposing sensitive staging details on
  publicly accessible environments
- **DX:** we relocated our skeleton `/extensions` into `/example-extensions` so
  that it's more obvious that they can be removed when starting a new project
- **DX**: we refactored global "atoms" stylesheets and merged them into a
  singular one `_design-token.scss`, imported by `main.scss`

- **Theme:** deleting an item from the cart now only triggers the required
  revalidations
- **Theme:** fixed registration when subscribing to the `newsletter`
- **Theme:** fixed an issue that caused an automatic submission of the choose
  payment form when selecting a payment method or accepting the GSC

  modifying it
