Plugins are a powerful abstraction that let you:

- add a new analytics provider (like Google analytics or Meta pixel)
- hook into an existing analytics provider plugin
- or add any kind of logic to react to visitor actions

Plugins can be broken down into 2 types:

- **Provider plugins** - connecting to third party analytic services
- **Custom plugins** - additional features, data manipulation, & any other side
  effects.

Both have the same signature, and are registered in the same way, here we will
explore how they are implemented within a Front-Commerce app.

You can look at the analytics library documentation to learn more about the
plugin types.

## Writing a new plugin

:::tip

You can also
[request and contribute plugins](https://getanalytics.io/plugins/request/)
within the analytics library ❤️ Open Source

:::

Let's say for this example we want to create a new provider plugin for a third
party analytics tool `acme`. We will name this plugin `acme`.

Provider plugins typically have the following structure:

1. Load in the third party analytics script via `initialize`
2. Implement `track` or `page` events to send data into a third party analytics
   tool

   _There is also another event `identify` which is not currently implemented in
   Front-commerce_

3. Have a loaded function to let analytics know when its safe to send the third
   party data.

Here is an example of the `acme` plugin:

```ts title="analytics/plugins/acme.ts"
import type { AnalyticsPlugin } from "@front-commerce/core/react";

// `settings` is the value defined in the plugin config in `config/analytics.ts`
export default function acmePluginExample(settings): AnalyticsPlugin {
  // return object for analytics to use
  return {
    /* All plugins require a name */
    name: "acme",
    /* Everything else below this is optional depending on your plugin requirements */
    config: {
      whatEver: settings.whatEver,
      elseYouNeed: settings.elseYouNeed,
    },
    initialize: ({ config }) => {
      // load provider script to page
    },
    page: ({ payload }) => {
      // call provider specific page tracking
    },
    track: ({ payload }) => {
      // call provider specific event tracking
    },
    identify: ({ payload }) => {
      // call provider specific user identify method
    },
    loaded: () => {
      // return boolean so analytics knows when it can send data to third party
      return !!window.myPluginLoaded;
    },
  };
}
```

</Step>

## Tracking `CommerceEvents`

:::info

In `v2` this was done by extending the
[`EcommercePlugin`](/docs/2.x/advanced/analytics/plugins#extending-with-ecommerceplugin)
which can still be used, but has a less comprehensive API.

We handle this internally for
[known plugins](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/784684ce56cca69ca5c2e42d5d421a8c0b4bb9c3/src/web/core/analytics/plugins/e-commerce/e-commerce.js#L6-11)
like the [`google-analytics`](https://getanalytics.io/plugins/google-analytics/)
plugin.

:::

If you want to track
[`CommerceEvents`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/3f6ed5af24b17a9c95f1dd024238bb2892e5075b/packages/core/analytics/plugins/commerce-events.ts)
in your custom plugin, you can do so by using the `commercePayload` object in
the `track` method access to the Front-Commerce fully typed tagging plan for the
`CommerceEvents`.

```tsx title="analytics/plugins/acme.ts"
import type { AnalyticsPlugin } from "@front-commerce/core/react";

export default function acmePluginExample(settings): AnalyticsPlugin {
  return {
    name: "acme",
    ...
    track: ({ payload, commercePayload }) => {
      if(!commercePayload){
        return // track normal events or not
      }

      // highlight-start
      // track commerce events
      const { event, ...rest } = commercePayload;
      switch (event) {
        case "Product Viewed":
          // track product viewed event
          break;
        case "Product Added":
          // track product added event
          break;
        case "Product Removed":
          // track product removed event
          break;
        case "Cart Viewed":
          // track cart viewed event
          break;
        case "Order Completed":
          // track order completed event
          break;
        default:
          // track other events
          break;
      }
      // highlight-end
    },
  };
}
```

</Step>
<Step>

## Using Plugins

In Front-Commerce the plugins are dynamically required via the `script` property
in your `app/config/analytics.ts` configuration, this allow us to only import
and load scripts based on authorisation (cookies), which in turn reduces the
page loading for your end users.

Let's add our `acme` plugin to our `app/config/analytics.ts` file.

```ts title="app/config/analytics.ts"
import { type AnalyticsConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/react";

export default {
  analytics: {
    enable: true,
    debug: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production",
    plugins: [
      // highlight-start
      {
        // remember to add the `acme` to your cookieServices config or disable the needConsent
        name: "acme",
        needConsent: true,
        // all these settings will be passed to your plugin script
        settings: {
          whatEver: "foo",
          elseYouNeed: "bar",
        }
        // add a dynamic import to load the plugin script
        script: () => import("./analytics/plugins/acme.ts"),
      },
      // highlight-end
    ],
  } satisfies AnalyticsConfig,
};
```

:::info REMINDER

Just like any other plugin, don't forget to setup the
[`cookiesServices.js`](/docs/3.x/guides/analytics/getting-started#the-gdpr-consent)
file accordingly, in order to load the newly created integration only when the
user has given their consent.
