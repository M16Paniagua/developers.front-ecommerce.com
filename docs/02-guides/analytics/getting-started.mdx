Front-Commerce uses [`analytics`](https://getanalytics.io/) under the hood. If
we represent how it works, it would look like this:

<Figure>
  <AnalyticsFigure
    aria-label="Schema explaining the concepts behind analytics"
    width="100%"
    className="text-black dark:text-white"
  />
</Figure>

Across your React application, you can track events using functions such as
`trackEvent`, `trackPage` or `useTrackPage`, `useTrackOnMount`. Then, the event
is dispatched to all the relevant plugins registered in your application, learn
more in the [Tracking API](tracking-api) docs.

This means that once you have correctly configured events in your React
Components, adding new tracking services is less risky: it has no impact on what
is being tracked.

# Analytics Overview

Front-Commerce uses [`analytics`](https://getanalytics.io/) to track events
across your React application. Events are dispatched to configured plugins,
making it easier to add new tracking services without changing your tracking
code.

## Key Features

- Track events with `trackEvent`
- Track page views with `trackPage` and `useTrackPage`
- Track component mounts with `useTrackOnMount`
- GDPR-compliant consent management
- Pluggable architecture for multiple analytics services

## Configure analytics

:::info

If you would like to directly jump into the code, you look at the
[plugins](/docs/3.x/category/plugins) often used within a Front-Commerce app.

:::

First you will need to configure your analytics by updating the configuration
file:

```ts title="app/config/analytics.ts"
import { type AnalyticsConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/react";

export default {
  analytics: {
    // Make sure that your analytics is enabled
    enable: true,
    // Enables the debug mode of the `analytics` library
    debug: true,
    // Pass any default settings to your plugins
    defaultSettings: {},
    // The list of plugins is defined here
    plugins: [
      {
        // The name allows to know if the user allowed to use
        // this tracking service or not, it should not be confused
        // with the name in the plugin script.
        name: "google-analytics",
        // Usually we always need to set it to true since GDPR
        needConsent: true,
        // Some plugins may have a privacy mode allowing them
        // to be enabled by default. Use this configuration to always
        // enable it. It is irrelevant if `needConsent` is `false`.
        enabledByDefault: true,
        // Settings can be an object or a function that will be called
        // with the current consent authorization from the visitor, it also
        // receive a 2nd parameter with codes of the other consents given.
        // Using a function can allow to have different settings depending
        // on the context
        settings: (authorization, otherAuthorizations) => {
          return {
            measurementIds: ["G-abc123"],
            gtagConfig: {
              anonymize_ip: !authorization,
            },
          };
        },
        // It should either return a promise function or a dynamic import to
        // the plugin script which will be added at to  the `analytics` library
        // see listed plugins: https://getanalytics.io/plugins/#supported-analytic-tools
        script: () => import("@analytics/google-analytics"),
      },
    ],
  } satisfies AnalyticsConfig,
};
```

### Retrieve authorized cookie services in analytics

In Front-Commerce, authorized cookie services must also be defined in
`app/config/analytics.ts` in order for them to be injected in the
`settings(authorization, otherAuthorizations)` callback (as its second
parameter).

This can be done by declaring "dummy" modules in `config/analytics.ts` such as:

```diff title="app/config/analytics.ts"
       // ...
+      {
+        name: "my-service",
+        needConsent: true,
+        script: () => () => {
+          return {
+            name: "my-service",
+          };
+        },
+      },
     ],
   },
 };
```

## The GDPR consent

If your plugins need consent of the user before running, you need to setup the
`cookiesServices.js` file. This file will let you define which cookies and
trackings services are used within your application and will let the user chose
which tracking service to allow.

### Configuration

```js title="app/config/cookiesServices.js"
export default {
  default_en: [
    {
      // Category of cookies to allow the user to accept all the plugins at once in a specific category
      title: "Analytics",
      description:
        "These cookies allows us to measure the traffic on our contents and hence to improve them.",
      services: [
        {
          // The name should be the same as mentioned in the `config/analytics.js` file
          name: "google-analytics",
          title: "Google Analytics",
          // display all the cookies managed by Google Analytics
          cookies: [
            "_ga",
            "_gat",
            "_gid",
            "__utma",
            "__utmb",
            "__utmc",
            "__utmt",
            "__utmz",
          ],
          // Display a more granular consent control per service
          consentOptions: [
            {
              name: "ad_storage",
              title: "Ads Storage",
              description:
                "Enables storage of advertising-related data like conversion measurement and remarketing",
            },
            {
              name: "ad_user_data",
              title: "Ads User Data",
              description:
                "Allows collection and processing of user data for advertising purposes",
            },
            {
              name: "ad_personalization",
              title: "Ads Personalization",
              description:
                "Enables personalized advertising based on user behavior and interests",
            },
            {
              name: "analytics_storage",
              title: "Analytics Storage",
              description:
                "Enables storage of analytics data to measure site usage and performance",
            },
          ],
          description:
            "Google Analytics cookies, from Google, are meant to gather statistics about visits.",
          link: "https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

The consent is stored in 3 separate cookies:

1. `hasConsent` - If the user provided a consent answer (`authorized` or
   `denied`) for all services.
2. `authorizations` - a JSON string of all consents given in the following
   format
   ```ts
     {
       [service_name]: true | false,
     }
   ```
3. `consentAuthorizations` - a JSON string of all consents given for a specific
   service in the following format
   ```ts
   {
     [service_name]: {
       [consent_name]: true | false,
     }
   }
   ```

:::info Important

The expiration for these three cookies' should be configured in
[`app/config/website.js`](/docs/2.x/reference/configurations#configwebsitejs).

```js title="app/config/website.js"
export default {
  default_image_url: "https://placehold.it/150x220",
  available_page_sizes: [18, 36],
  ....
  rewrittenToRoot: ["/home"],
  useUserTitles: false,
  // highlight-next-line
  cookieMaxAgeInMonths: 12,
};
```

:::

### Granular Consent Updates

When using custom consent options defined in your `cookiesServices.js` file, you
can implement granular consent updates by adding an `updateConsent` method to
your analytics plugin. This method allows you to handle consent changes for
specific tracking features.

The `updateConsent` method is already included in the built-in
`google-analytics` and `google-tag-manager` plugins, but you'll need to
implement it yourself for custom plugins.

Here's how to add consent updates to your plugin:

```ts title="app/config/analytics.ts"
import { type AnalyticsConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/react";

export default {
  analytics: {
    // ...
    plugins: [
      // ...
      {
        name: "my-service",
        // ...
        script: () => () => {
          return {
            name: "my-service",
            initialize: () => {...},
            track: () => {...},
            page: () => {...},
            // highlight-start
            methods: {
              updateConsent: (consent: Record<string, boolean>) => {
                // handle consent update for your service
                // eg: {ad_storage:true, ad_user_data:false, ad_personalization:true, analytics_storage:true}
              },
            },
            // highlight-end
          };
        }
      },
    ],
  } satisfies AnalyticsConfig,
};
```
