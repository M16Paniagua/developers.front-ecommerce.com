<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> allows your back office
users write their content without needing any HTML or React knowledge. This is the
case in most CMS tools nowadays. The output though is usually HTML which does not
necessarily match the React components you've built in your Front-Commerce application.

This is why we've built a `theme/modules/Wysiwyg` component in Front-Commerce.  
In this guide you will learn how to use it and how to customize the displayed
components.

## `<Wysiwyg />` usage

Here is an example of using this component:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import Wysiwyg from "theme/modules/Wysiwyg";

export default function BlogContent(props) {
  return <Wysiwyg content={props.cms.contentWysiwyg} />;
}
```

The `contentWysiwyg` property originates from a GraphQL field `Wysiwyg`.  
To see the required fields, see the `WysiwygFragment` fragment reference
available at  
[`theme/modules/Wysiwyg/WysiwygFragment.gql`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/3.4.0/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/modules/Wysiwyg/WysiwygFragment.gql),  
and using in `CmsPageFragment` available at  
[`theme/pages/CmsPage/CmsPageFragment.gql`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/3.4.0/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/pages/CmsPage/CmsPageFragment.gql).

## WYSIWYG customization

**Prerequisite:** Please note that the following sections use advanced
techniques in Front-Commerce. You especially need to be familiar with the
[GraphQL extension mechanisms](./extend-the-graphql-schema.mdx) before being
able to fully apprehend what is explained. If some areas are still unclear,
please feel free to reach out!

### Create a new WYSIWYG Type

Each service is likely to have their own set of rules and constraints when it
comes to WYSIWYG. For instance, in Magento you have shortcodes that are defined
by using the `{% raw %}{{ }}{% endraw %}` syntax. In WordPress, you will have
`[]` instead. Despite this syntax difference you will have also some
functionality difference. For instance, Magento allows you to display a link to
a product while WordPress have media galleries. This means that each service
will have its own set of transformations for WYSIWYG data.

We are solving this by creating a new WYSIWYG Type for each service. In the
previous section, we've mentioned the type `MagentoWysiwyg`. It uses the exact
same mechanisms as the one we will describe below.

If you want to customize `MagentoWysiwyg` instead, please refer to
[WYSIWYG Plateform section](./customize-wysiwyg-platform.mdx#magentowysiwyg).

#### Register your widget type at the GraphQL level

1.  Add `Front-Commerce/Wysiwyg` as a dependency of your GraphQL module (for
    instance at `extensions/acme-extension/modules/wysiwyg/`), and define a new
    GraphQL type that should implement the `Wysiwyg` interface:

    ```ts title="extensions/acme-extension/modules/wysiwyg/index.ts"
    import { createGraphQLModule } from "@front-commerce/core/graphql";

    export default createGraphQLModule({
      namespace: "ACME/Wysiwyg",
      dependencies: ["Front-Commerce/Wysiwyg"],
      loadRuntime: () => import("./runtime"),
      typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
        type CustomWysiwyg implements Wysiwyg {
          raw: String
          childNodes: JSON
          data: [WysiwygNodeData]
        }
      `,
    });
    ```

1.  Register this new type as a WYSIWYG type in your GraphQL module's runtime:

    ```ts title="extensions/acme-extension/modules/wysiwyg/runtime.ts"
    import { createGraphQLRuntime } from "@front-commerce/core/graphql";

    export default createGraphQLRuntime({
      contextEnhancer: ({ loaders }) => {
        loaders.Wysiwyg.registerWysiwygType(
          // the name of the GraphQL type you have just created
          "CustomWysiwyg",
          // The list of shortcodes that are parsed and replaced in your wysiwyg content
          [
            {
              // regex to identify the shortcode within your HTML code
              regex: /\{\{media url="(.*?)"\}\}/gi,
              // How to replace the given shortcode
              replacement: (match, url) => `/media/${url}`,
            },
          ]
        );
      };
    });
    ```

#### Map this new type to a specific React component that will apply the needed transformations before displaying the content

1.  Duplicate the
    [`DefaultWysiwyg.js`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/3.4.0/packages/theme-chocolatine/theme/modules/Wysiwyg/DefaultWysiwyg.js)
    component to `theme/modules/Wysiwyg/CustomWysiwyg`.
1.  Override `theme/modules/Wysiwyg/appWysiwygComponents.js` and map your new
    `CustomWysiwyg` typename (the one used in your GraphQL schema) to
    `theme/modules/Wysiwyg/CustomWysiwyg` (the file that tells React how to
    display the content)

    ```ts title="theme/modules/Wysiwyg/appWysiwygComponents.js"
    import CustomWysiwyg from "theme/modules/Wysiwyg/CustomWysiwyg";

    export default {
      CustomWysiwyg,
    };
    ```

That's it, you have a new `CustomWysiwyg` type. However, the components rendered
are still simple HTML tags. If you want to add interactivity, you will need to
refer to the `theme/modules/Wysiwyg/CustomWysiwyg` you have created.

In this file you will notice that there is a `defaultComponentsMap` constant.
This object is used to reference how to render each html tag in your WYSIWYG
component. We call these **transforms**: they transform an html tag into a React
component. This is what will allow you to finely tune how your WYSIWYG is
displayed and add interactivity to your content.

For instance, if you want your `h2` tags to have some additional classes, you
could use the following `defaultComponentsMap` instead:

```ts
const defaultComponentsMap = {
  h2: (props) => <h2 {...props} className="wysiwyg-h2" />,
};
```

The props available represent the HTML attributes coming from your WYSIWYG
content. The only difference compared to traditional HTML is that `class` is
renamed to `className` to better support React patterns and the `props.children`
is an already constructed React element.

:::note

If the component is complex, please think about code splitting them to avoid too
large bundles on pages that don't need them. If you want to learn more about
code splitting pattern, you can check
[this article](https://web.dev/articles/code-splitting-suspense) or
[React's documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy#suspense-for-code-splitting)

### Fetching data to render WYSIWYG components

You can now transform HTML tags into React components. However, in some cases
the data provided in the raw HTML you've received from your remote service won't
be enough to display your component. For instance, you may have a
`<product-name sku="VSK12" />` that is supposed to display the product's name.
But all you have in the attributes is the SKU. This can be done by associating a
`WysiwygNodeData` with your HTML node.

Indeed, when you've created your GraphQL `CustomWysiwyg` type, you have
declared: `childNodes` (`JSON`) and `data` (`[WysiwygNodeData]`). By default,
`data` will always be empty. But you can tell the WYSIWYG loader to fetch data  
for some specific `childNodes` (_each representing an HTML tag_). This means  
that for `product-name`, you will associate a new `data` element that will
contain the whole product data needed to display the component. To do so, you
need to follow these steps:

#### Add the product data to your GraphQL schema

1.  Make sure that your dependencies are up to date in your GraphQL module, and
    define a new `WysiwygProductNameData` type that implements `WysiwygNodeData`
    and expose all the data you need to display your component

    ```ts title="extensions/acme-extension/modules/wysiwyg/index.ts"
    import { createGraphQLModule } from "@front-commerce/core/graphql";

    export default createGraphQLModule({
      namespace: "ACME/Cms",
      loadRuntime: () => import("./runtime"),
      // highlight-start
      dependencies: [
        "Front-Commerce/Wysiwyg", // ensure that Wysiwyg related features are available
        "Magento2/Catalog/Product", // ensure that you can fetch a product in your Wysiwyg data
      ],
      typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
        type WysiwygProductNameData implements WysiwygNodeData {
          dataId: ID
          product: Product
        }
      `,
      // highlight-end
    });
    ```

1.  Setup the resolvers to tell GraphQL how to fetch the `product` field in your
    new `WysiwygProductNameData` type
    ```ts title="extensions/acme-extension/modules/wysiwyg/resolvers.js"
    export default {
      WysiwygProductNameData: {
        product: ({ node }, _, { loaders }) => {
          const productSkuAttribute = node.attrs.find(
            ({ name }) => name === "sku"
          );
          if (!productSkuAttribute) {
            return null;
          }
          return loaders.Product.load(productSkuAttribute.value);
        },
      },
    };
    ```
1.  Register the HTML tag and associate it with the GraphQL type

    ```ts title="extensions/acme-extension/modules/wysiwyg/runtime.ts"
    import { createGraphQLRuntime } from "@front-commerce/core/graphql";
    import resolvers from "./resolvers";

    export default createGraphQLRuntime({
      resolvers: resolvers,
      contextEnhancer: ({ loaders }) => {
        loaders.Wysiwyg.registerNodeType(
          "product-name", // the tag name in your HTML
          "WysiwygProductNameData" // The associated GraphQL type name
        );
      };
    });
    ```

#### Fetch the data to make it available in your custom Product Name component

1. Override the `WysiwygFragment.gql` to fetch the new `WysiwygProductNameData`

   ```graphql title="theme/modules/Wysiwyg/WysiwygFragment.gql"
   #import "theme/modules/Wysiwyg/MagentoWysiwyg/MagentoWysiwygFragment.gql"

   fragment WysiwygFragment on Wysiwyg {
     childNodes
     data {
       dataId
       // highlight-start
       ... on WysiwygProductNameData {
         product {
           sku
           name
         }
       }
       // highlight-end
     }
     ... on MagentoWysiwyg {
       ...MagentoWysiwygFragment
     }
   }
   ```

   Feel free to split this in a Fragment dedicated to your `CustomWysiwyg` just
   like it is done in the core for `MagentoWysiwyg`.

2. Reference the `product-name` tag in your componentMap and use the new `data`
   prop available in the mapped component.

   ```ts title="extensions/acme-extension/theme/modules/wysiwyg/DefaultWysiwyg.js"
   const defaultComponentsMap = {
     "product-name": (props) => <span>{props.data.product.name}</span>,
   };
   ```

   :::note Important

   Please keep in mind that for simplicity's sake, the product name component is
   not code split, but if it grows in complexity, please make sure to code split
   it using [`lazy()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy#lazy) and
   [`<Suspense>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to avoid too large
   bundles. See
   [React's documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy#suspense-for-code-splitting)
   for more information.

### Nested Wysiwyg components

In some cases, you will need to render a WYSIWYG component inside another
WYSIWYG component. For instance, this can be the case if you implement a Product
Preview feature in your WYSIWYG and want to display the description of the
product. It is likely to have formatted text that can be defined directly in the
administration panel.

Please be advised that we won't support infinite nested WYSIWYG component since
it represents a huge performance risk for both you and your users. The goal
would be instead to use only simplified WYSIWYG for nested data. In our Product
Preview case, this means that instead of rendering a `MagentoWysiwyg` you would
only render a `DefaultWysiwyg` that won't fetch additional data but only
transform the basic HTML.

If you need more information about implementing this, please <ContactLink />.

### Dynamic styles

You may want to render inline styles dynamically when displaying WYSIWYG
components. It can be required if content managers customizes how a given
element is displayed for instance (e.g: alignment, border color etcâ€¦).

Each `<Wysiwyg>` component is wrapped into a unique id. The Front-Commerce
WYSIWYG mechanism provides a `<Style>` component that allows you to render
styles that could be restricted to the current WYSIWYG context only (and prevent
side effects on other parts of the page)

Here is how you could use it from a WYSIWYG component:

```tsx
import React from "react";
// highlight-next-line
import Style from "theme/modules/Wysiwyg/Style";

const MyComponent = ({ children, data }) => {
  const { id, align, content } = data;
  return (
    <>
      // highlight-start
      <Style rootSelector="#html-body">
        {`#html-body [data-my-component-id=${id}] .my-component__content {
            text-align: "${align}";
          }`}
      </Style>
      // highlight-end
      <div class="my-component" data-my-component-id={id}>
        <p class="my-component__introduction">Lorem ipsumâ€¦</p>
        <p class="my-component__content">{content}</p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

It will generate an inline `<style>` HTML tag with the following content
(`#html-body` being replaced with the automatically generated WYSIWYG element
id):

```html
<style>
  #wysiwyg-styles-xxxxxxxx-yyyy
    [data-my-component-id="42"]
    .my-component__content {
    text-align: "center";
  }
</style>
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Everything explained previously is the core behavior of the
WYSIWYG implemented in Front-Commerce. It is _very_ flexible as it was
implemented over a lot of iterations and feedbacks from our integrators.
However, with this flexibility comes a bit of a complexity. Please keep in mind
that you don't need to fully understand all of it to get started. However, if
you've understood most of it, you will be able to dive into our code and
understand how we have implemented platform specific WYSIWYG components. You
could even use those components as an inspiration to develop your own specific
behaviors.
