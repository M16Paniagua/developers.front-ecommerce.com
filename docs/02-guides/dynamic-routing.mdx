## What is dynamic routing?

Dynamic routes are generated based on the data available in your application,
allowing for more meaningful and SEO-friendly URLs. For example, instead of a
generic URL such as `/product/sku-6`, you can have a more descriptive URL like
`/acme-product.html`.

Consider a Remix route for your products defined as `routes/product.$id.tsx`. By
leveraging dynamic routes, you can replace generic product URLs with
SEO-friendly alternatives.

#### Generic Route Example

- URL: `/product/sku-6`

#### SEO-Friendly Route Example

- URL: `/acme-product.html`

By implementing dynamic routes, you enhance the readability and search engine
optimization (SEO) of your URLs, which can improve your site's visibility and
user experience.

## How to create dynamic routes?

<Steps>
<Step>

### Create a `DynamicRouteUrlMatcher`

First, define a class that implements the `DynamicRouteUrlMatcher` interface to
match URLs to your application's routes.

```ts title="extension/UrlMatcher.ts"
import type {
  DynamicRouteUrlMatcher,
  MatchedDynamicRouteUrl,
} from "@front-commerce/core";

// Define hardcoded routes for demonstration purposes
const hardcodedRoutes = [
  {
    type: "product"
    path: "/acme-product.html",
    identifier: "sku-6",
  },
];

class UrlMatcher implements DynamicRouteUrlMatcher {
  matchUrl(path: string): MatchedDynamicRouteUrl | undefined {
    // Find a matching route in the hardcoded list, ideally this will be from a remote resource
    const match = hardcodedRoutes.find((route) => route.path === path);
    if (!match) {
      return undefined;
    }
    return {
      path: match.path,
      identifier: match.identifier,
      params: {
        id: match.identifier, // The product ID to pass to the route
      },
    };
  }
}
```

This class checks if a provided URL matches any of the predefined paths and
returns the corresponding route details.

</Step>
<Step>

### Register a `DynamicRouteUrlMatcher`

Next, integrate the UrlMatcher into your application by registering it with the
DynamicRoutes registry.

```ts title="extension/index.ts"
import { defineExtension } from "@front-commerce/core";
import UrlMatcher from "./UrlMatcher";

export default defineExtension({
  name: "acme-extension",
  meta: import.meta,
  // highlight-start
  unstable_lifecycleHooks: {
    onServerServicesInit: async (services, request, config) => {
      services.DynamicRoutes.registerUrlMatcher(
        "AcmeUrlMatcher",
        () => new UrlMatcher()
      );
    },
  },
  // highlight-end
});
```

This configuration ensures that your UrlMatcher is included in the server's
initialization process, making it active for incoming requests.

</Step>

<Step>

### Add `handle` export to Remix route

Update your Remix route to use the dynamic route identifier by adding it to the
`handle` export.

```tsx title="routes/product.$id.tsx"
import { createHandle } from "@front-commerce/remix/handle";

export const handle = createHandle({
  dynamicRoute: {
    type: "product", // to match the type of your url matcher
    priority: 1, // higher priority routes are matched first
  },
});
```

If you have multiple pages that use the same `type` for their dynamic routes,
you can use the `priority` field to determine the order in which they are
matched. Higher priority routes are matched first. for example the following
`routes/acme-product.$id.tsx` will be matched before `routes/product.$id.tsx`:

```tsx title="routes/acme-product.$id.tsx"
import { createHandle } from "@front-commerce/remix/handle";

export const handle = createHandle({
  dynamicRoute: {
    type: "product",
    priority: 2,
  },
});
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Replace `useLoaderData` with `useDynamicRouteLoaderData`

Finally, replace the `useLoaderData` hook with the `useDynamicRouteLoaderData`
which provides the dynamic route data.

```tsx title="routes/product.$id.tsx"
// remove-next-line
import { useLoaderData } from "@front-commerce/remix/react";
// add-next-line
import { useDynamicRouteLoaderData } from "@front-commerce/remix/react";
import { createHandle } from "@front-commerce/remix/handle";

export const loader = () => {...}

export const handle = createHandle(...);

export default function Product() {
  // remove-next-line
  const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
  // add-next-line
  const data = useDynamicRouteLoaderData<typeof loader>();

  return <div>Product: {data.product.name}</div>;
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Visiting the Dynamic Route

When you navigate to `/acme-product.html`, the system uses your `UrlMatcher` to
resolve the URL to the product page corresponding to `sku-6`. This approach
allows you to manage URLs dynamically based on your application's data
requirements.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Extending the type declarations

For TypeScript support of the `type` field in your handle export, you can extend
the `DynamicRoutesCompositionList` interface from the `@front-commerce/types`
package to include your custom types.

<Steps>

<Step>

<span className="mt-1" />

#### Install the `@front-commerce/types` package

Ensure you have the `@front-commerce/types` package installed in your project,
as it provides the necessary types for the `DynamicRoutes`.

```bash
$ pnpm add @front-commerce/types
```

</Step>

<Step>

<span className="mt-1" />

#### Create declaration file

This declaration can be placed in a `dynamic-routes.d.ts` file within your
extension's types directory.

```ts title="extension/types/dynamic-routes.d.ts"
declare module "@front-commerce/types" {
  export interface DynamicRoutesCompositionList {
    contentful: "contentful"; // example of another type
  }
}
```

Existing types can be found in the
[theme-chocolatine package](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/3c31a7d63ba6fa4726bcf4997188d38be7254248/packages/theme-chocolatine/types/dynamic-routes.d.ts#L1-7).

:::note

TypeScript will merge all the found module declarations, so you can add your own
without redefining the whole module.

:::

</Step>

<Step>

<span className="mt-1" />

#### Ensure your declaration is included in the tsconfig.json

This declaration can be placed in a `dynamic-routes.d.ts` file within your
extension's types directory.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "include": [
    "./**/*.jsx",
    "./**/*.js",
    "./**/*.ts",
    "./**/*.tsx",
    // add-next-line
    "./extensions/**/types/*.d.ts"
  ]
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

<span className="mt-1" />

#### Verify your handle export

```tsx title="routes/contentful.$id.tsx"
import { createHandle } from "@front-commerce/remix/handle";

export const handle = createHandle({
  dynamicRoute: {
    type: "contentful", // this should now autocomplete in your IDE.
  },
});
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Known Limitations

### Matching Catch-All Routes (Splat Routes)

In Remix, you can create a catch-all route that matches any path, for example:

| URL      | Matched Route      |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| `/foo/a` | `routes/foo.$.tsx` |
| `/bar/a` | `routes/bar.$.tsx` |

However, it's not possible to create a URL Matcher for catch-all routes because
the URL will still be matched by Remix. Attempting to match `/example` to
`routes/foo.$.tsx` using a URL matcher will result in the following error:

```
Error: Route "routes/foo.$" does not match URL "/example"
```

### Dynamic Route Catch-All Placeholder

To implement <abbr title="Client Side Rendering">CSR</abbr> for dynamic routes,
the application requires specific internal logic in the
[`routes/_main.$.tsx`](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/integration/fc-1646-dynamic-routes/packages/theme-chocolatine/routes/_main.$.tsx?ref_type=heads)
file.

If you have overwritten this route, you will need to manually apply and maintain
this logic to ensure proper functionality.
