## Entering and exiting the maintenance mode

The maintenance mode is activated by setting the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_FORCE_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`
in your Front-Commerce project. Once that is done, any request done in your
application will show the maintenance page instead.

:::tip

The skeleton provides an
[maintenance mode demo example extension](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/tree/main/skeleton/example-extensions/maintenance-mode-demo?ref_type=heads)
with three custom routes to show the interactions with the maintenance mode.

:::

## Testing and customizing the maintenance page

The maintenance page is an HTML file served directly by the express server in
case the site is in maintenance mode. You can customize the maintenance page by
editing the `public/__front_commerce/maintenance.html` file in your
Front-Commerce project.

:::info

Note that the user experience on the maitnenance page will evolve in the
following version of Front-Commerce, for example be able to use base and custom
components from the theme.

:::

In order to facilitate the edition of this page, you can display it in
development mode by
[activating the maintenance mode](/docs/3.x/guides/maintenance-mode#entering-and-exiting-the-maintenance-mode).

## Controlling Access During Maintenance

To bypass the maintenance mode for certain IP addresses you can configure the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZED_IPS` environment variable. Please
note that you can have multiple IPs separated by a comma like:

```shell title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZED_IPS=127.0.0.1,83.65.12.111,2ce8:c427::7156:ad8e
```

:::caution

Please configure **both v4 and v6** IP as much as possible. You can retrieve
your own IP addresses with https://www.whatismyip.com/
