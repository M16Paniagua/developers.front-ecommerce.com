## Rate Limiter Service

The Rate Limiter service provides a robust solution for managing and preventing
excessive usage by imposing limits on the number of requests that users can make
within a specified period. This service utilizes Redis for storage and supports
integration into both HTTP contexts and GraphQL operations.

### Features

- **Redis-backed Storage**: Utilizes Redis to efficiently track request counts
  and support high concurrency.
- **Flexible Rate Limits**: Configure max requests and duration per rate limit
  namespace.
- **HTTP and GraphQL Support**: Easily integrate rate limiting into Remix
  actions/loaders and GraphQL resolvers.
- **Automated Response Handling**: Automatically sends HTTP 429 Too Many
  Requests responses when a limit is exceeded.

### Service Configuration

The rate limiter requires a Redis configuration to function. Upon instantiation,
it subscribes to a Redis instance and sets up namespaces for different rate
limits.

To configure the service, you can add the following to your
`front-commerce.config.ts`:

```ts title="front-commerce.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/config";

export default defineConfig({
  // ...other configuration options
  rateLimiter: {
    // feel free to extract this configuration in a separate file to ease maintenance
    redis: {
      host: process.env.FRONT_COMMERCE_CLOUD_REDIS_SESSIONS_HOST,
      port: process.env.FRONT_COMMERCE_CLOUD_REDIS_SESSIONS_PORT || 6379,
      db: process.env.FRONT_COMMERCE_CLOUD_REDIS_SESSIONS_DB || 2,
    },
  },
});
```

:::tip

We've suggested a configuration which shares the same Redis DB than sessions.
While it's not required, we think it makes sense because both share the same
kind of responsibilities.

## Implementing Rate Limits

The service provides two main methods for limiting rates:

- `limitHTTPResource(namespace, requestId, options)`: Limits rates for HTTP
  requests by namespace and request ID.
- `limitGraphQLResource(fieldPath, requestId, options)`: Limits rates for
  GraphQL queries based on the resolver field path.

There is also an additional exported method in the `graphql` exports:

- `limitRateByGraphQLResolver(options, resolver)`: Wraps a GraphQL resolver with
  rate limiting.

### Remix Loader

In the Remix framework, the rate limiter can be employed within a loader to
control request frequency based on URL path and user IP.

```ts
import { FrontCommerceApp } from "@front-commerce/remix";
import type { LoaderFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";

export const loader = async ({ context, request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const app = new FrontCommerceApp(context.frontCommerce);

  await app.services.RateLimiter.limitHTTPResource(
    new URL(request.url).pathname,
    app.user.clientIp,
    {
      max: 5,
      duration: "1m",
    }
  );

  // Perform loader-specific logic here
};
```

### Remix Action

Similarly, for actions in Remix, the rate limiter ensures that excessive
requests are controlled at the action level, again based on URL path and user
IP.

```ts
import { FrontCommerceApp } from "@front-commerce/remix";
import type { ActionFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";

export const action = async ({ context, request }: ActionFunctionArgs) => {
  const app = new FrontCommerceApp(context.frontCommerce);

  await app.services.RateLimiter.limitHTTPResource(
    new URL(request.url).pathname,
    app.user.clientIp,
    {
      max: 5,
      duration: "1m",
    }
  );

  // Perform action-specific logic here
};
```

### GraphQL Resolver

For GraphQL resolvers, the rate limiter can be directly applied to individual
queries or mutations to manage resource consumption effectively.

```ts
import { createGraphQLRuntime } from "@front-commerce/core/graphql";

export default createGraphQLRuntime({
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      helloWorld: async (parent, args, { user, services }) => {
        await services.RateLimiter.limitGraphQLResource(
          "Query:helloWorld",
          user.clientIp,
          {
            max: 5,
            duration: "1m",
          }
        );

        // Perform resolver logic here
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Or you can use the `limitRateByGraphQLResolver` method to wrap the resolver with
a rate limit:

```ts
import {
  createGraphQLRuntime,
  limitRateByGraphQLResolver,
} from "@front-commerce/core/graphql";

export default createGraphQLRuntime({
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      helloWorld: limitRateByGraphQLResolver(
        {
          max: 5,
          duration: "1m",
        },
        async (parent, args, context, info) => {
          // Perform resolver logic here
        }
      ),
    },
  },
});
```

:::info

This method will automatically apply a namespace based on the resolver path, for
example `Query:helloWorld`.

## Additional Tips

- **Handling Overlimits**: The service automatically handles cases where the
  limit is exceeded by sending a `429` status code, but this can be customized
  further if different handling is required.
- **Monitoring and Logs**: Integration with `winston` for logging allows
  tracking down issues and misuse effectively.
- **Custom namespace and requestId**: The `namespace` and `requestId` parameters
  can be customized to suit your application's requirements.
