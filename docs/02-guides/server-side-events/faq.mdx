## What events are implemented in Front-Commerce?

:::info

Currently, Front-Commerce only implement the OrderPlaced events, but more events will be added in the future.

:::

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `OrderPlaced` | This event is triggered when an order is placed. |

## How can I test Server events in local environment?

To test server events in a local environment, you need a Redis server, and you must configure the IP address in your .env file:

```
FRONT_COMMERCE_SERVER_EVENT_REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
# The following entry is to be defined only if you don't use default Redis port
FRONT_COMMERCE_SERVER_EVENT_REDIS_PORT=6379
```

hen you need to start the worker by running the following command from your project : `pnpm run worker`

If you would like to obtain additional information and enable debug mode, you can do one of the following:

- Run the command with the DEBUG flag : `DEBUG=front-commerce:server-events:cli pnpm run worker`
- Add the debug flag to your `.env` file : `DEBUG=front-commerce:server-events:cli`

## What data is published for a Server Event?

The data returned by the events is an object with the following properties :

```json
{
  event_type: string, // Type of the event defined in the Event emitter
  created_at: string // Timestamp of when the event was created
  payload: object // The data of the event
  metadata: object // The metadata of the event
}
```
