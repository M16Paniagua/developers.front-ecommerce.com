## What is an Adapter?

An Adapter is a function that will link external services users to your
e-commerce account.

They are defined in the supported e-commerce connector packages.

They receive a user with the following properties:

| Name        | Description           | Type   |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------ |
| `email`     | The user's email      | string |
| `firstname` | The user's first name | string |
| `lastname`  | The user's last name  | string |

## Register a custom adapter

This is an advanced use-case, we recommend you to reach our customer support to
know your needs before proceeding.

  ...
  unstable_lifecycleHooks: {

      services.ExternalLogin.registerAdapter(new LoginAdapter());
    }
  }
})

```
