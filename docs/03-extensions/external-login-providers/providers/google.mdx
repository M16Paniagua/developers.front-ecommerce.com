## Google setup

The `GoogleProvider` needs the `clientId` and the `clientSecret` to work. You
can get these from your "OAuth2.0 Client" of your app on the
[google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
Note that you need to create one if you have not already.

### Configuring Redirect URIs

You need to configure the allowed redirect URIs under your "OAuth2.0 Client" of
your app on the
[Google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
Note that the `Authorized redirect URIs` should contain all your stores URLs
followed by `/external-login/google/callback`.

For example if you have two stores `https://example.com/en` and
`https://example.com/fr`, you need to put
`https://example.com/en/external-login/google/callback` and
`https://example.com/fr/external-login/google/callback` in the
`Valid OAuth Redirect URIs` field.

:::tip

When testing in localhost, you must register your localhost url as a redirect
URI : `http://localhost:4000/external-login/google/callback`
