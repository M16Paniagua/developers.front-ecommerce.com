## Front-Commerce Payments

First ensure you have installed the package:

```bash
$ pnpm install @front-commerce/paypal
```

## Front-Commerce configuration

To enable the extension, you need to add the PayPal extension definition to your
`front-commerce.config.ts`. When doing that, you need to pass the _flavor_ in
which you want to run the extension, the _flavor_ must be one of the following
values:

- `magento1`
- `magento2`

For instance, in a magento2 based project, the `front-commerce.config.ts` file
would be something like:

```typescript title="front-commerce.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/config";
import themeChocolatine from "@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine";
import magento2 from "@front-commerce/magento2";
// highlight-next-line
import paypal from "@front-commerce/paypal";
import storesConfig from "./app/config/stores";
import cacheConfig from "./app/config/caching";

export default defineConfig({
  extensions: [
    themeChocolatine(),
    magento2({ storesConfig }),
    // highlight-next-line
    paypal("magento2"), // ⚠️ needs to be after themeChocolatine()
  ],
  stores: storesConfig,
  cache: cacheConfig,
  configuration: {
    providers: [],
  },
});
```

### Environment variables

This extension requires environment variable to work properly. Please refer to
the
[Environment variables reference](/docs/3.x/extensions/paypal/reference/environment-variables)
for more information.

### Register your PayPal payment components

:::note

The current method for configuring payment components is an interim solution. We
recognize that it may be cumbersome for users. Please be assured that this
process will undergo significant improvements in the future, as Front-Commerce
evolves to include more versatile extension points for Payment systems.

:::

1. Override the file that lets you register additional payments methods in
   Front-Commerce

   ```shell
   mkdir -p app/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/
   cp -u node_modules/@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js app/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js
   ```

2. Register PaypalButton

   ```diff title="app/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js"
   +import PaypalButton from "theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/PaypalButton";

   const ComponentMap = {
   +  paypal_button: PaypalButton,
   };

   ...
   ```

After restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able to see a new payment method
called "credit card" in your checkout step.

### Advanced: customize data sent to Paypal

:::caution WIP

<span>
  This advanced pattern must be documented with further details. While we are
  working on it, please <ContactLink /> if you need further assistance.

:::

The Paypal payment module is extensible. It leverages Front-Commerce's "data
transform" pattern to allow developers to customize payloads sent to Paypal for
Payer data and Payer units.

Both the payer data and payer units objects can be customized at application
level. It allows to add additional metadata depending on your own logic. For
this, you can use the `registerPayerDataTransform` and
`registerPurchaseUnitsDataTransform` methods of the Paypal loader to add your
custom transformers.

See the tests for an example (while a detailed documentation is being written):

## Magento2 module

:::caution WIP

This integration is aimed at being transparent for administrators and
developers. That is why we haven't duplicated documentation from
[existing Magento resources](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/sales/paypal-express-checkout.html)
. Take a look at
[this blog to find the credentials required by Magento](https://store.magenest.com/blog/paypal/#2_Get_API_Credentials)
. Please <ContactLink /> if you need further assistance.

:::

Front-Commerce Magento2 module contains
[headless payment adapters](/docs/2.x/magento2/headless-payments) for the
**Paypal Express** payment method.

The Paypal module must be configured in a normal way, as for a non-headless
Magento store.

## Magento1 (OpenMage LTS) module

:::caution WIP

:::

Front-Commerce Magento1 module contains
[headless payment adapters](/docs/2.x/magento1/headless-payments) for the
**Paypal Standard** payment method.

The Paypal module must be configured in a normal way, as for a non-headless
Magento store.

To enable **Paypal Standard** (instead of **Paypal Express**), you may have to
update your database manually. See
[Disable paypal express when enabling paypal standard in Magento 1.9.1](https://magento.stackexchange.com/a/75971)
for details.
