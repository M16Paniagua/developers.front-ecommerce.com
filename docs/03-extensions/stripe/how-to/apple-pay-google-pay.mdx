If enabled in your Stripe account, Apple Pay and Google Pay payment methods are
supported and can be used in your Front-Commerce store. Please refer to
[the Google Pay with Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/google-pay) and
[the Apple Pay with Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/apple-pay) documentation to
learn how to configure those payment methods.

:::tip

For those payment methods to show up, your Front-Commerce store must use the
https protocol even in a test environment.
