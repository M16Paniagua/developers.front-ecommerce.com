Optionally the environment variable `FRONT_COMMERCE_STRIPE_DISABLE_CAPTURE` can
be set to `true` to configure the Stripe module so that the payment is not
automatically captured. You can opt-in to this behavior, by adding the variable
to your `.env`:

```diff title=".env"
# Stripe payment
# API Keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys
FRONT_COMMERCE_WEB_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_xxxxxx
FRONT_COMMERCE_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_xxxxxx
+FRONT_COMMERCE_STRIPE_DISABLE_CAPTURE=true
```
