## Installation

First ensure you have installed the package:

```bash
$ pnpm install @front-commerce/stripe
```

## Front-Commerce configuration

[After installing the Stripe package](/docs/3.x/extensions/stripe/#installation),
you need to enable the corresponding extension. For that, you need to tweak your
`front-commerce.config.ts` file like this:

```typescript title="front-commerce.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@front-commerce/core/config";
import themeChocolatine from "@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine";
import magento2 from "@front-commerce/magento2";
// highlight-next-line
import stripe from "@front-commerce/stripe";
import storesConfig from "./app/config/stores";
import cacheConfig from "./app/config/caching";

export default defineConfig({
  extensions: [
    themeChocolatine(),
    magento2({ storesConfig }),
    // highlight-next-line
    stripe(), // ⚠️ needs to be after themeChocolatine()
  ],
  stores: storesConfig,
  cache: cacheConfig,
  configuration: {
    providers: [],
  },
});
```

## Register your Stripe payment components

:::note

The current method for configuring payment components is an interim solution. We
recognize that it may be cumbersome for users. Please be assured that this
process will undergo significant improvements in the future, as Front-Commerce
evolves to include more versatile extension points for Payment systems.

:::

1. Override the file that lets you register additional payments methods in
   Front-Commerce

   ```shell
   mkdir -p app/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/
   cp -u node_modules/@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js app/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js
   ```

2. Register Stripe

   ```diff title="app/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js"
   +import StripeCheckout from "theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/StripeCheckout";

   const ComponentMap = {
   +  stripe: StripeCheckout,
   };

   ...
   ```

After restarting Front-Commerce, you should be able to see a new payment method
called "credit card" in your checkout step.
