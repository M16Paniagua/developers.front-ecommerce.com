The offline page is accessible when you disable your network while navigating in
your shop. You can preview it at `/__front-commerce/offline`. You can then edit
the `theme/pages/Offline` component to make sure that this page suits your
brand.

1. Override the Offline page component:

```shell
mkdir -p app/theme/pages/Offline
cp -u node_modules/@front-commerce/theme-chocolatine/pages/Offline/Offline.tsx app/theme/pages/Offline/Offline.tsx
```

2. Customize the page with your brand's identity.
