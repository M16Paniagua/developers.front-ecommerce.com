  [reference](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/getting-started/fundamentals#domains-and-paths))
- `paths`: paths which should be proxied to TwicPics. (see
  [reference](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/getting-started/fundamentals#domains-and-paths))

```js title="app/config/images.js"
const config = {
  twicpics: {
    domain: "https://<domain>.twic.pics",
    paths: [
      {
        source: "/media", // the source to match, (eg `/media` would match `/media/image.jpg`, or `https://my-domain.com/media` would match `https://my-domain.com/media/image.jpg`)
        path: "/my-media", // the path configured in TwicPics as a path for the source.
      },
    ],
  },
