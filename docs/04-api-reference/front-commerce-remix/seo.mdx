## API Reference

### `/sitemap.xml` route

A remix route that generates a sitemap for your site. The sitemap is generated
based on the static pages in your site, and the dynamic pages that are generated
by your [`handle`](/docs/3.x/guides/customize-the-generated-sitemap) exports for
each page.

### `/robots.txt` route

A remix route that generates a `robots.txt` file for your site. If your
`FRONT_COMMERCE_ENV` is set to `production`, the `robots.txt` file will allow
all search engines to crawl your site. If your `FRONT_COMMERCE_ENV` is set to
`development`, the `robots.txt` file will disallow all search engines from
crawling your site.
