## Update dependencies

Update all your `@front-commerce/*` dependencies to this version:

```shell
pnpm update "@front-commerce/*@3.6.0"
```

## Automated Migration

We provide a codemod to automatically update your codebase to the latest version
of Front-Commerce. This tool will update your code when possible and flag the
places where you need to manually update your code (with `// TODO Codemod`
comments).

```shell
pnpm run front-commerce migrate --transform 3.6.0
```

## Custom Scalar support in GraphQL schema

In this release, we've introduced a new way to define custom scalars in your
GraphQL schema.

To learn more please refer to the
[Custom Scalars](/docs/3.x/guides/extend-the-graphql-schema#adding-custom-scalars-to-the-schema)
guide.

:::note

If you have patched to core to allow for custom scalars, you can now safely
remove the patch.
