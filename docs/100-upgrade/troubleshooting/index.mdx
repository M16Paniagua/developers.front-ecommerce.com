## CSS can disappear in development

<SinceVersion tag="3.4" />

This is a known React issue that is fixed in their
[canary release channel](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries). If
you understand the risks involved, you can pin your app to a specific
[React version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react?activetab=versions) and then
use
[package overrides](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides)
to ensure this is the only version of React used throughout your project. For
example:

```json title=package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "18.3.0-canary-...",
    "react-dom": "18.3.0-canary-..."
  },
  "overrides": {
    "react": "18.3.0-canary-...",
    "react-dom": "18.3.0-canary-..."
  }
}
```

:::info

For reference, this is how Next.js treats React versioning internally on your
behalf, so this approach is more widely used than you might expect, even though
it's not something Remix provides as a default.

Again, it's worth stressing that this issue with styles that were injected by
Vite only happens in development. **Production builds won't have this issue**
