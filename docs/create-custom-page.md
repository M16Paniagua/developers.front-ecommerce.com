title: Create a custom page
---

When creating an online store, you often have to create whole new pages specific
to your store.

Let's look at how it works by adding a "Hello World" page to Front Commerce
Lite. This page will be accessible at `/greetings` and will display
`Hello World`.

## TL;DR

In order to do so, we need to:

1.  Create our component page in our theme
2.  Define the associated route in our router

## 1. Create a new page component

First, let's create a new component in our theme. This component will be the one
telling our application what to display on the `/greetings` page.

In order to keep our code clean, we will put this component into the `pages`
folder of our theme: `src/web/theme/pages/<our-page>.js`.

> **Front Commerce:** If we were to use the paid version, the page should be
> added at the same path but within our custom module rather than in core
> modules.

Once created, this component should render a basic "Hello World" message.

```js
// src/web/theme/pages/Greetings.js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { H1 } from "theme/components/atoms/Typography/Heading";

class Greetings extends Component {
  render() {
    return <H1>Hello world</H1>;
  }
}

export default Greetings;
```

## 2. Define the associated route

Once the component is created, we must declare our new route. A route is a React
element that specifies what to display if a specific path is matched. In our
case, we want it to render the `Greetings` component when the user visits the
`/greetings` URL. To do so, we use
[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy),
the most popular routing library in the React ecosystem.

In Front Commerce Lite, routes are gathered in a single file:
`src/web/theme/Routes.js`. So, we will add our `/greetings` route within this
file.

```diff
// ... imports
import Route from "react-router/Route";
+import Greetings from "theme/pages/Greetings";

export default () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Switch>
+      <Route
+        path="/greetings" // The URL that should display our page
+        render={() => <Greetings />} // what page to render
+      />
      {/* Other routes here */}
    </Switch>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

We can now navigate to
[http://localhost:8080/greetings](http://localhost:8080/greetings) and it should
render your fantastic `Hello World` message!

> **Front Commerce:** If we were to use the paid version, there would be no such
> root file since routes need to be aggregated from different modules. To solve
> this, we would use a `web/routes.js` file within our custom module. This file
> would export the list of the module's custom routes. It would look like this:
>
> ```js
> import React from "react";
> import Route from "react-router/Route";
> import Greetings from "theme/pages/Greetings";
>
> export default () => [
>   <Route
>     key="greetings"
>     path="/greetings" // The URL that should display our page
>     render={() => <Greetings />} // what should be rendered
>   />
> ];
> ```

Once you have a custom page up and running, feel free to change the page
component (`Greetings`) however you want. You can make it fetch data, render
data, send a mutationâ€¦ After all, it's a component. It will work exactly the
same way as any other component in your application.
