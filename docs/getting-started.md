This page will help you getting started with Front-Commerce
for a Magento2 store. Keep in mind that working with other
e-commerce solutions is possible, but not yet part of the core.
[Contact us](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com) if you would like to
use Front-Commerce with another solution.

## TL;DR

Installing Front-Commerce is about:

* ensuring you have access to our codebase (license…)
* installing the Front-Commerce extension in your Magento2 store
* configuring Magento2 so it could communicate with Front-Commerce
* initializing a new Front-Commerce project
* run the design system
* run the application
* tweaking the configurations to match your needs

Are you ready?
