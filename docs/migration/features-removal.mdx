title: Features removal
description:
  This page lists the features that have been removed in `3.x` because they are
  irrelevant in the current context or were not used (we think).

import ContactLink from "@site/src/components/ContactLink";

:::note

If you are a Front-Commerce customer using one of this feature in your `2.x`
project, please <ContactLink>contact us</ContactLink> as you plan your migration
so we could reevaluate our decision.

## GraphQL Rate Limiting

In version 3.0, we removed the
[Rate Limiting](/docs/2.x/advanced/graphql/rate-limiting)
feature from GraphQL. Since GraphQL is not exposed through HTTP by default, the
rate limiting feature no longer makes sense at this level.

As a consequence, if you were using the following functions you must update your
codebase to remove these features:

- `limitRateByClientIp` for resolvers
- `rateLimiters` from the GraphQL context
- `config/rateLimit.js` configuration file
- `makeRateLimiters` internal API
- or a direct import from the `graphql-rate-limit` package

In the core, it was only used for the `sendContactEmail` mutation.
