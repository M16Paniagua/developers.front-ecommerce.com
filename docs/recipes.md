We want Front-Commerce to be the solution that will make you the
most productive to craft the shopping experiences your user deserves. That means that it should not get into your way
while you are trying to prototype, test or implement a feature.
We built it this way and want to document it this way too!

We believe in practical documentations. Instead of explaining each
concept by looking at the API and all the ways to use it, we
chose to illustrate them with task oriented recipes.

Our goal is — over time — to have a delightful cookbook of recipes
that could be followed by a team for their day-to-day activities
until they become autonomous enough to do it naturally.

Here is an overview of the available recipes. Please let us
know what you would like us to document here.
