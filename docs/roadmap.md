title: Roadmap

We built Front-Commerce with [an ambitious vision](vision.md)
so we have a lot of things on our plate!

## Web technologies are exciting, but the fatigue is here!

Due to the nature of the product, our roadmap is doomed to evolve
often according to the technologies around it.

Here are examples:

* a browser will support a new web API, making it relevant for
  production purpose
* a library we use will release a new major version, bringing
  awesomeness to our world
* a solution we connect with will release a new version, with API
  changes (breaking, or allowing us to interact with it in a more
  convenient way)
* what was once considered — at least by us — as a good practice
  has now found a better alternative

While all of these things happens, **we have a promise to keep with you:
you won’t have to suffer from this fatigue by using Front-Commerce.**

Thus we will have some work to make it available in the product,
without breaking your code or by making the upgrade as smooth as possible.

## We are a bootstrapped company

We have limited resources and have to focus on the Most Important Things ™
first to match business outcomes.

That is the reason why we sometimes have to introduce technical debt — but we are aware of it and plan to pay it back — or implement a component in a simple way for now.
Our roadmap will thus contain some technical debt reduction items, and
technical improvements to some low level components.

We are dedicated to make those changes as seamless for you as possible. Most
of the time you would benefit from them without any code changes, otherwise
we will publish in our migration guides what you should do if you want to
leverage them.

## We are part of an ecosystem

Truly valuing our Customers and Partners means that our roadmap will integrate
your feedbacks.

Here are examples:

* ouch! A critical — or not so critical — bug has been noticed… release needed!
* developers are working on a specific OS and are being annoyed by some
  slowness, or a bug with tho tooling
* project·s will need a new feature, and we know it would be of benefit
  as part of the core
* supporting a new solution is one of the most asked request we have, we
  have to investigate and build a POC

## We have dreams too

Sometimes it is also great to make our dreams come true, and be a bit selfish!

Be prepared to see this refactoring, a new feature that excites part of our team,
or a new tool for the documentation in our roadmap…
