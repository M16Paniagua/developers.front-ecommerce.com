title: Why Front-Commerce?
---

This page will is aimed at explaining our vision for building Front-Commerce.

No matter what the current state of the project is, it will always evolve
according to this vision. If you share it with us, it is very likely that you
will be very productive with Front-Commerce and should start working with it
right away.

## Once upon a time

Back in 2015 in a french agency named [Occitech](https://www.occitech.fr), a
friendly team of developers saw the announcements of the new major version
of the eCommerce solution they were experts in: **Magento2**.

A few things were very cool (Service API and testing for instance), but something
make them feel bad… **very bad**: after all these years, the frontend part had
not been reworked and this major version was adding some engineering layers on top
of it. **It was like a J2EE version of a 2008 HTML website…** with jQuery instead of
Prototype, a dying JS framework named KnockoutJS plus a bunch of XML files!
**¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**

ECommerce was not their only activity, and they were also developing custom
business application with rich domains and task oriented UIs. That’s how they
were noticing the rise of what was called _« Component Based »_ frontend
architectures.

React was gaining traction, and this team took a lot of pleasure developing
their first projects with it. **Its declarative nature, and the composition it
allowed make them feel productive and turned complex UIs into things much more
easy to reason about.**

Then came **the announcements** of
[Falcor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiO1f6h15c8) by Netflix and
[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/blog/graphql-a-query-language/) by Facebook.
Pieces came together and Component Based UIs were now possible (and already
in production on huge sites). Design (Brad Frost’s
[Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology,
Pattern libraries, new tools such as Sketch) and engineering practices could
live together to build scalable and maintainable web and mobile UIs.
**It was a simpler and cleaner solution to the same problems solved
by what they disliked in Magento2.**

Afterall — they decided during a retrospective — eCommerce is about creating
custom user experiences, and it is were we spend most of our time
when building and maintaining an online store: let’s make it a pleasant experience
and **never do a Magento2 theme using their stack**.

**Front-Commerce was born.**

Inspired another new trend towards simpler backend services and headless
eCommerce solutions (the JAMStack, and solutions such as
[Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/) or [Moltin](https://moltin.com/)),
they decided to introduce a middleware to loosen their dependency on Magento2
and embrace the upcoming changes that may happen in the eCommerce world.

## What is is

Fast forward to today, this team evolved and we are now proud of what we
achieved since that time.

After a POC and a developing the React frontend using Falcor for data fetching,
we demo-ed the product to several people and got a lot of very positive feedbacks.
When we decided to « go for it » and launch the Front-Commerce product for real
(in October 2016) we moved to GraphQL and (the yet young) Apollo client and embrace
their rich and innovative ecosystem.

Since then, we worked hard to build a product that support a wide range of
eCommerce features

## What do we want it to be
