title: Why Front-Commerce?
---

This page is aimed at explaining our vision for building Front-Commerce.

No matter what the current state of the project is, it will always evolve
according to this vision. If you share it with us, it is very likely that you
will be very productive with Front-Commerce and should start working with it
right away.

But first, let's start with a bit of background to fully understand where this
vision comes from.

## Once upon a time

Back in 2015, in a french agency named [Occitech](https://www.occitech.fr), a
friendly team of developers saw the announcements of the new major version
of the eCommerce solution they were experts in: **Magento2**.

A few things were very cool (Service API and testing for instance), but something
made them feel bad… **very bad**: after all these years, the frontend part had
not been reworked and this major version was adding new engineering layers on top
of it. **It was like a J2EE version of a 2008 HTML website…** with jQuery instead
of Prototype, a dying JS framework named KnockoutJS plus a bunch of XML files!
**¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**

ECommerce was not their only activity, and they were also developing custom
business application with rich domains and task oriented UIs. That’s how they
were noticing the rise of what was called _« Component Based »_ frontend
architectures.

React was gaining traction, and this team enjoyed developing their first
projects with it. **Its declarative and composable nature of it made them
productive and turned complex UIs into things easier to reason about.**

Then came **the announcements** of
[Falcor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiO1f6h15c8) by Netflix and
[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/blog/graphql-a-query-language/) by Facebook.
Pieces came together and Component Based UIs were now possible (and already
in production on huge sites). Design methodologies (Brad Frost’s
[Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)), tools
Pattern libraries, Sketch) and engineering practices could now live together
to build scalable and maintainable web and mobile UIs. **It was a simpler
and cleaner solution to the same problems solved by what they disliked in
Magento2.**

After all — they decided during a retrospective — eCommerce is about creating
custom user experiences, and it is where we spend most of our time
when building and maintaining an online store: let’s make it a pleasant experience
and **never do a Magento2 theme using their stack**.

**Front-Commerce was born.**

Inspired by another trend towards simpler backend services and headless
eCommerce solutions (the JAMStack, and solutions such as
[Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/) or [Moltin](https://moltin.com/)),
they decided to introduce a middleware to loosen their dependency on Magento2
and embrace the upcoming changes that may happen in the eCommerce world.

## What it is

Fast forward to today, this team evolved and we are now proud of what we
achieved since that time.

After a <abbr title="Proof Of Concept">POC</abbr> and developing the React
frontend using Falcor for data fetching, we demo-ed the product to several
people and got a lot of very positive feedbacks. When we decided to « go for
it » and launch the Front-Commerce product for real (in October 2016) we
moved to GraphQL and (the yet young) Apollo client to embrace their rich and
innovative ecosystem.

Since then, we worked hard to build a product that supports a wide range of
eCommerce features
