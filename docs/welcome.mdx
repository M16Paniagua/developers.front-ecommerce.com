Grasping all the concepts around a product such as Front-Commerce is exciting
but can be intimidating. Therefore, we tried to create and organize this
documentation so that you could quickly find the information you need depending
on your context.

## Welcome to Front-Commerce’s official documentation

Even though Front-Commerce is a proprietary product, we have decided to maintain
our documentation in the open.

**It means that you could understand how the product works and see code samples,
to help you decide whether Front-Commerce is relevant for your project or not.**

## Getting Help

If you need help or more information about a topic, there are different ways
[you can get help](https://help.front-commerce.com/en/articles/5910607-when-how-can-i-reach-the-front-commerce-support-team).

## First Steps

We recommend you to start with the
[Getting Started](/docs/3.x/category/get-started) section. Then, depending on
your context, you can browse the documentation by category:

- [**Guides**](/docs/3.x/category/guides) are step-by-step tutorials to help you
  achieve a specific goal with Front-Commerce, no matter your context.
- **API Reference** is a complete reference of all the APIs available in
  Front-Commerce's core.
- **Extensions** are additional features that you can leverage on top of
  Front-Commerce's core to adapt to your composable commerce needs. It includes
  our official extensions such as
  [our default theme (Chocolatine)](/docs/3.x/extensions/theme-chocolatine/),
  [Magento 2](/docs/3.x/extensions/magento2/),
  [Contentful](/docs/3.x/extensions/contentful/) or
  [Algolia](/docs/3.x/extensions/algolia/) specific documentations.
- **Concepts** are articles that explain the concepts behind Front-Commerce and
  why we made certain choices.
- **Upgrade Guides** are practical guides to help you upgrade your
  Front-Commerce project to a new version.
