## Content-Driven Commerce with Prismic

eCommerce has evolved from a transactional process into a content-driven experience. Marketers work hard to create superior content because it leads to a superior Customer Experience.

In this release, we've improved our Prismic connector to serve this goal. Developers can now leverage Prismic features in their Front-Commerce application in many new ways:
- embrace the **"Don't Ship Pages, Ship a Page Builder"** Prismic vision with [Content Slices](/docs/prismic/content-slices.html) without sacrificing creative freedom
- improve Content manager experience with [Integration Fields](/docs/prismic/integration-fields.html) so they can create rich content referencing any Front-Commerce data without leaving the writing room (Products, Categories, â€¦)
- optimize SEO with [Routable types](/docs/prismic/routable-types.html). Expose custom Prismic content on any URL managed from Prismic and seamlessly include these pages in Front-Commerce's sitemap

These features are deeply integrated into Front-Commerce core features and benefits from all the optimizations you already know (preloading, performant images, â€¦).

**We're excited to see what you will build with it!**

## Unified Commerce with Proximis

Customers interact with brands in many different ways. We're partnering with [Proximis](https://www.proximis.com/en) to bring [the benefits of headless commerce](https://www.front-commerce.com/en/front-commerce-a-modern-ecommerce-architecture/) to Retailers selling online and in store.

In this alpha release, we've made progress on every features involved during a customer journey (PLP, PDP, Cart, Store locatorâ€¦). This connector will be production ready before the end of the year.

[Contact us](https://www.front-commerce.com/en/contact-us/) to discuss your project.

## Summer backlog cleaning

Front-Commerce 2.8 contains many different improvements and bugfixes. We've scheduled some time to clean our backlog and reduce technical debt.

While some changes were related to our internal test suite, we also fixed warnings and errors aggregated from Front-Commerce Cloud customers logs. We've also spent time on performance testing and profiled our server to optimize some areas.

[Bugfixes](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/releases/2.8.0#bug-fixes) will be backported to all 2.4+ Front-Commerce versions in the next few days, so they can benefit to every Customers.
