Today we are excited to unveil our new website:
https://developers.front-commerce.com.

It marks the beginning of Front-Commerce’s distribution, and **is an answer to
the traction we have seen over the past few weeks**. This website is for
developers wanting a better understanding of what Front-Commerce is, and why we
made it this way.

<!-- more -->

This is
[our official documentation website](http://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/welcome.html)
too! Even though Front-Commerce is a proprietary product, **we have decided to
maintain our documentation in the open.** It will grow over the next few weeks,
as we are working towards Front-Commerce 1.0. You can contribute by sending us
questions, opening issues or fixing typos / grammar mistakes in a
<abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr>.

<abbr title="Progressive Web Applications">PWA</abbr> for eCommerce is a hot
topic right now, and we receive more and more questions about Front-Commerce. We
hope that you will find the information you are looking for and continue the
discussion with us.

We are also excited to attend — and sponsor —
**[Reacticon](https://reacticon.org/)**, the first conference and hackathon
focused on PWAs in the Magento community. Since Front-Commerce supports most of
Magento2 features — with shops in production — it is a perfect timing for us to
meet with developers and get their feedbacks and expectations.

Reacticon is a great opportunity for us to discuss with maintainers of other
solutions such as
[Magento’s PWA Studio](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Introducing-Magento-PWA-Studio/ba-p/74636),
[Deity](https://deity.io/) or [Vue Storefront](https://www.vuestorefront.io/) to
share ideas, maybe some tooling and understand our differences.

On a business side, we are looking to work with close partners and **build a
rich ecosystem with different domains**:

- UX designers,
- front-end agencies,
- microservices addicts,
- Magento agencies,
- accessibility experts,
- e-commerce consultants

If you share [our vision](/docs/vision.html) and believe in our product,
[you could be one of them](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com)!

Time has come for us to share more about our technical choices, vision, roadmap
and day to day eCommerce user-centric development using modern technologies… so
stay tuned!

Feel free to [contact us](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com) if you have any
question or need guidance for your project.
