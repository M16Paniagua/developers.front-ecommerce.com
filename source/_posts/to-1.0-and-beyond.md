Front-Commerce is here to stay.
Here is what we have been up to over the past few months, and what to expect from us in a near future.

Regular releases, a dedicated team, a revamped documentation, first trainings, Magento1 support, a quest for new partners…

## Front-Commerce is taking off as a product

We have been quiet since October, as it was a crucial period in our history.
During these months we have taken the time to evaluate different opportunities and action plans to decide about Front-Commerce’s future as a product.

After many thoughts, we finally decided to continue on the path we were following: Front-Commerce is here to stay, as an independent product!

As of today, we now have 3 people working full-time on Front-Commerce. This dedicated team is still in close relationship with Occitech’s team, who keeps maintaining and iterating on the biggest Front-Commerce projects in production to date.

Our goal is to maintain this close collaboration, by migrating Occitech’s projects to the latest version of Front-Commerce before every official release.
**We believe this is a key feature of our [release process](/docs/appendices/roadmap.html#Release-process), to ensure that we are providing a seamless migration path and detect potential issues as early as possible.**

## Meet Karim, a new kind of Developer in the team!

Front-Commerce is (and will remain) a product aimed at empowering developers on their path towards modern web development, with the latest technologies and a high level of quality. We know that developers value our product and are proud about the quality of relationships built in our technical ecosystem over 2018.

But hey, we are a company with a much ambitious vision!
It is time for us to build a solid community of teams sharing our love for a better, faster web.

That’s why we are happy to officially introduce Karim, our new team member!
Karim is in charge of Business Development &amp; Partnership since more than a month now.

> Hi everyone! I’m Karim, a ………………………………….
> Nice to meet you! Let’s get in touch……………

Karim and Pierre will attend [OroVibe France](https://orovibe.com/2019france/en) next week, it would be a good way to say us hi!

## `1.0.0-alpha.0`, `1.0.0-alpha.1`… every release brings us closest to `1.0.0`!

Until 2018, we have been _dogfooding_ and incubating Front-Commerce by delivering several projects in production as part of Occitech.

Armed with experience from these real-world use-cases, we started internal refactorings and reorganization to allow Front-Commerce to be used with confidence by different teams over time.
These « big bang » backward incompatible changes have been our first priority to ensure that the projects which were being started would not need tedious rewrites when upgrading.

Since our first `alpha` release we have been working on incremental improvements, reducing technical debt, and will continue until we are confident that we could follow [our roadmap](/docs/appendices/roadmap.html) with semantic versioning in mind.

We invite you to read our [releases page](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/releases) (if you have access to our private Gitlab instance), or our [Migration Guides](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/appendices/migration-guides.html).
We will announce new releases on this blog too from now on.

## Dig into our documentation

This is definitely one of the most long-awaited resource.
Partners, potential customers and developers have been asking it for a while and it was one of the first thing we wanted to deliver to them/you.
It marks our confidence in our current API and architecture (we did not want to document things that would radically change), and the start for a continuous improvement.

Our code is closed source, but our culture is open source! This is why we wanted to make our official documentation public (some API references may still be restricted though).

**We are proud to announce our revamped version of https://developers.front-commerce.com** (this site), [almost 1 year](/blog/2018/03/15/hello-world/) after publishing its first version.
As every documentation, this is an ongoing process.
We are commited to spend 1 or 2 days a week to publish new pages, and have « documented » in our [Definition Of Done](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-done/) so every new feature or change will come with new content in our documentation.

We know that many teams are benchmarking PWA solutions for eCommerce as we speak, and we hope that this resource will help understanding how Front-Commerce is one of the most mature solution out there.

If something is missing or you would like to know more, as always [contact us](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com) and we will do our best to help you.

## Our first trainings

Since we started to focus on Front-Commerce as a product, we have also been busy to create training materials.
Several teams have chosen Front-Commerce as their first PWA solution for eCommerce, and we know that it could be tough to learn those new practices for a team.

We have been happy to deliver our first training a few weeks ago!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We were proud to train the friendly and talented <a href="https://twitter.com/webqam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@webqam</a> team so they could start building their first project using Front-Commerce! <a href="https://t.co/uApS5ff9Qw">pic.twitter.com/uApS5ff9Qw</a></p>&mdash; Front-Commerce (@Front_Commerce) <a href="https://twitter.com/Front_Commerce/status/1089866342277283842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">28 janvier 2019</a></blockquote>

It is one the [professional services](https://www.front-commerce.com/en/support-2/) we provide to help teams delivering successful projects using Front-Commerce.
We plan to develop this in the next few months, so stay tuned!

## Magento1 support on the way

We are happy to share with you one of the most exciting news of these days: **Front-Commerce will support Magento1**.

You may think that Magento1’s End Of Life would mean that you will have to migrate to Magento2 to benefit from new improvements and the latest PWA goodness… not anymore!

We are proud and confident that an alternative is possible, and we want Front-Commerce to play a key part in this.
Our partner [PH2M](https://www.ph2m.com), one of our earliest supporter, is currently working on making Magento1 a headless solution compatible with Front-Commerce’s GraphQL middleware out of the box.

Magento1 is not dead, and a community [has a plan for the time after Magento 1 EOL](https://openmage.github.io/2019/01/20/after-m1-eol.html).
This is also why commited our support to OpenMage by becoming a partner.

**The first Magento-LTS / Front-Commerce PWA project is being designed as we speak and we target a public Front-Commerce demo and stable code by May 1st.**
It will be a fully-featured integration (not a <abbr title="Proof Of Concept">POC</abbr>) that will allow you to go live quickly, leveraging Front-Commerce’s maturity with Magento2 stores in production for over more than a year.

Be assured that we will publish more content about it in the future, but please [contact us if you are interested to be one of our early-adopters](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com).

## With you?

If all of this sounds interesting to you, let’s [get in touch](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com)!

We could introduce the project more in-depth, answer your technical questions, provide support for making your projects a success and onboard your team on the « PWA bandwagon » with us!
