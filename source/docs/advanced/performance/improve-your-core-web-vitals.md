## Front-Commerce tips

### Mark above-the-fold images as priority

Using: `<Image src="xxxx" priority />`

### Improve your font performances

- Use WOFF2 format
- Use `font-display: optional`
- Preload key fonts by naming them with the suffix: `*.priority.woff2`

### One query per route

You must aim at One GraphQL query per Front-Commerce route. Keep additional queries for secondary content.

Ensure that this query is preloadable (using the top level `graphqlWithPreload` HOC).
