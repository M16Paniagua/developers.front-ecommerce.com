Before going to production, you want to ensure that everything is in place. But some features are not critical enough to block your developments and you may have missed them. These are still a big part of any Front-Commerce application.

To ensure that you are good to go, you can go through this checklist :

* [ ] Style your **Offline page**
  This page is accessible when you disable your network while navigating in your shop.
  If you have `FRONT_COMMERCE_ENV !== "production"` this page will also be available at `/__front-commerce/offline`. You can then edit the `theme/pages/Offline` component to make sure that this page suits your brand.
* [ ] Style your **Maintenance page**
  This page is accessible when your backend returns is in Maintenance mode (503).
  If you have `FRONT_COMMERCE_ENV !== "production"` this page will also be available at `/__front-commerce/maintenance`. You can then edit the `theme/pages/Maintenance` component to make sure that this page suits your brand.
* [ ] Ensure your server can serve the application in **HTTPS** mode.
  Front-Commerce is aimed at being exposed in HTTPS when in production mode (`NODE_ENV === "production"`). It will redirect users to an HTTPS url if they try to access a page using HTTP. Cookies are also set with secure mode.
  If you want to overcome this limitation (which we donâ€™t recommend!), you may use the [`FRONT_COMMERCE_UNSAFE_INSECURE_MODE` environment variable](/docs/reference/environment-variables.html#Host).
* [ ] Ensure that the `robots.txt` has been overridden, which instructs bots what they can access. By default, [it forbids crawling to prevent unexpectedly exposing dev applications](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/-/blob/main/public/robots.txt).
