This area will contain the Migration steps to follow for upgrading your store to new Front-Commerce versions.

Our goal is to make migrations as smooth as possible. This is why we try to make many changes backword compatible by using deprecation warnings. The deprecation warnings are usually removed in the next breaking release.

## `1.0.0-alpha.2` -> `1.0.0-beta.0`

### Translations

We have introduced the mechanism of [Translation Fallback](https://developers.front-commerce.com/docs/advanced/theme/translations.html#Translations-fallback). This is means that you will have fewer conflicts during next upgrades.

### Improved search experience

While working on our compatibility with Magento 2.3, we decided to use [ElasticSuite](https://elasticsuite.io/). Learn more about it in our [announcement](http://localhost:4444/blog/2019/05/07/release-1.0.0-beta.0/#Improved-search-experience).

During this change, we needed to update some parts of the GraphQL schema. If you don't use our implementation, this won't impact you. However, if you do, here is what changed in the schema:

* `AttributeBucket.swatch` was removed in favor of `AttributeBucket.productAttributeValue.swatch`. The reasoning behind this is that what's interesting is not the swatch itself but the whole attribute which is available at `AttributeBucket.productAttributeValue`.
* Layers related types are now interfaces (Bucket, DynamicFacet, FixedFacet) with concrete implementations (AttributeFacet...).
* `DynamicFacet.bucket` has been renamed in
`DynamicFacet.buckets` (plural).
* `SearchResult.layer` was renamed to `SearchResult.products`

Please check your front-end queries to ensure to update them accordingly. If you need any help about these, feel free to [contact us](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com).

### Wishlist

A basic wishlist is now available in Front-Commerce by default with the Magento2 module.
However, for existing shops, you need to check a few things in order to make sure that the wishlist is available for your customers. Indeed, the impacted components are likely to have been overridden.

1. Upgrade your `front-commerce/magento2-module` to version `1.0.0-beta.1` or higher.
    * make sure to update `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAGENTO_MODULE_VERSION` accordingly
2. Check that the wishlist is available in the customer's account
    * the route must exist (`node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/pages/Account/Account.js`)
    * a link must in the account navigation (`node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/User/AccountNavigation/AccountNavigation.js`)
3. Check that the user can actually add the product to their wishlist
    * either on the product page itself (`node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/ProductView/Synthesis/Synthesis.js`)
    * or on the product item used for product listings (`src/web/theme/modules/ProductView/ProductItem/ProductItemActions/ProductItemActions.js`)

### Storybook 5

Your styleguide is now powered by Storybook 5. This might have an impact on the organization of your custom stories but they will still appear in your styleguide.

To move your stories in the correct sections, please set your story name like this: `section|path.of.your.story.Component`

### Payments

#### Stripe

We have added an initial implementation of Stripe's embedded payments. This is still in early stage but will let your customers pay your order successfully. See [Stripe](https://github.com/front-commerce/developers.front-commerce.com/issues/47#issuecomment-476633486).

#### Integrations

Previously, some payment React components were loaded by default in the Checkout even though those payment methods were not used. This resulted in a heavier js bundle. This, we have removed those components by default.

If you relied on them, you will now need to add them manually. We are still in the process of documenting it, but you can find the main informations in [this issue](https://github.com/front-commerce/developers.front-commerce.com/issues/47) at the moment.

### Deprecations

* Environment variables from your `.env` will in the future be loaded dynamically. You won't need to rebuild your server to update your server's environment variables. To ensure that you have the newest behavior, please set `FRONT_COMMERCE_USE_SERVER_DYNAMIC_ENV=true`. To keep the deprecated one, please use `FRONT_COMMERCE_USE_SERVER_DYNAMIC_ENV=false`. See [How to update environment variables](/docs/reference/environment-variables.html#How-to-update-environment-variables).
* While upgrading the search behavior, we have also changed deprecated the `search.blacklistKeys` configuration in `config/website.js`. This now should be `search.ignoredAttributeKeys` which is less offensive and more explicit. Moreover, `search.fixedFacets` and `search.categoriesField` are no longer used.
* While upgrading the search behavior, we have splitted the core's search definition from the Magento 2's implementation. This means that future integrations will let you use different backends while keeping your frontend intact. We've grouped the core's search functionality in `server/modules/front-commerce/search`. This  means that we have also moved `server/modules/front-commerce-core` to `server/modules/front-commerce/core`. By default, `.front-commerce.js` should now use `server/modules/front-commerce`, in order to load both the core and the search.

## `1.0.0-alpha.1` -> `1.0.0-alpha.2`

### GraphQL

[`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) has been updated to a new major version (0.13.2 -> 14.1.1) that includes several breaking changes.
There is only one breaking change that may impact your current application: scalar types are now checked more rigorously (see [the PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/1382)), meaning you may have to convert strings to numbers (etc.) in your application.

The symptoms are errors of this type in your application:

> Expected type Int; Int cannot represent non-integer value: "1"

See [v14.0.0â€™s releases notes](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/releases/tag/v14.0.0) for an exhaustive list of breaking changes and other minor releases for new features.

### Atoms refactoring ([#178](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/178))

One of the goals of `1.0.0` is to rewrite our CSS classes to make it easier for new external contributors to dive into Front-Commerce. However, this is a lot of work because of the many features already implemented in Front-Commerce. Thus, we've splitted this in 5 smaller iterations (see ([#97](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/97)) for more details). This release is the first step towards this goal.

This means that:

- CSS classes of atoms are no longer used directly in other components
- CSS classes of atoms now respect the BEM convention. However we are not too rigid about this convention because avoiding dependencies between components is our first priority. (Currently in the process of writing a documentation page explaining the whys behind this decision.)

On your part, the changes that will affect you the most are about the following components:

- `<Button>`: changed the classes and gathered the styles properties under an `appearance` property
- `<Link>`: changed the classes and use the classes of the `<Button>` if you use the `buttonAppearance` property.
  This is relevant because for UI reasons you might want to render a Button, but it should still redirect to a new page under the hood.
- `<ResizedImage>`: added a surrounding div and changed classes to better handle fluid vs fixed images.
  Moreover, you can now update only the components that handle the markup of a ResizedImage without overriding the core component. Please refer to `Image`, `ImageLoading` and `ImageNotFound` in `theme/components/atoms/ResizedImage` folder.
- `<Input>`: changed input classes
- `<NumberInput>`: changed the style to add +/- buttons next to the input button.

You should also check that if you have overriden some of the other components.

### Variant properties

For style variants of a component we had several behaviors in place:

- `type` property which was an enumeration of the variants
- `variantName` properties (for instance `primary` and `warning` for `<Button>`)

To improve consistency, we've decided to change this by always using an `appearance` property which will be an enumeration like what was done with the `type` property.

The goal is to avoid variants collision and to make it explicit when a variant only affects the style of a component.

These changes are backward compatible. Deprecation warnings will appear if you keep using the old properties.

### Files loading in a Scss file

Until now, files used in a `.scss` file were to be loaded from the public directory or by using long and tidious file paths. This is no longer the case. You can now use relative imports.

For instance, if you have a `theme/components/atoms/Icon/_Icon.scss` file, you will be able to import the font file directly:

```diff
-src: url('../theme/components/atoms/Icon/font-awesome-4.7.0/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
+src: url('./font-awesome-4.7.0/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
```

This is usually done for background-images and fonts. Please look for any `url` keyword in your scss files to make sure that you update your paths accordingly.

### Cart refactoring

The Cart was one of the most outdated part of our code. This is no longer the case! Components and styles have been refactored to better match the style of the checkout and account pages. This is a great step forward because it is rarely heavily customized by online shops and it will now be a nice default.

#### Translations

Since few integrators had the opportunity to customize the existing Cart, the main changes you will need to take care of are the translations.

<details>
<summary>List of the changed translations regarding the Cart</summary>
<ul>
  <li>components.atoms.Form.Input.NumberInput.decrement</li>
  <li>components.atoms.Form.Input.NumberInput.increment</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartContent.CartHeader.products</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemInfos.quantity</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemInfos.subtotal</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemInfos.unitPrice</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemOptionsUpdater.button</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemOptionsUpdater.error</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemOptionsUpdater.submit</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemOptionsUpdater.success</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemOptionsUpdater.title</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemQuantityForm.error</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemQuantityForm.refresh</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.CartItemQuantityForm.success</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartItem.remove</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.MiniCart.MiniCartContent.checkout</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.MiniCart.MiniCartContent.seeCart</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.MiniCart.MiniCartContent.discount</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartTitle.continueShopping</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartTitle.title</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartAlerts.contactUs</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartAlerts.fromRenew</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartAlerts.paymentError</li>
  <li>modules.Cart.CartAlerts.renewError</li>
</ul>
</details>

Please refer to the translations files in the core of front-commerce to get the new translations within your application. This process should be easier in the future by using [translations fallbacks that is under development](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce/issues/54#note_152801124).

#### Styles

If you have overriden the `theme/modules/_modules.scss` file and didn't import the `front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/_modules.scss` file, you will need to add the new styles for the Cart:

```diff
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/EmptyCart/EmptyCart";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartTitle/CartTitle";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartContent/CartContent";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartContent/CartHeader/CartHeader";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItem";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemInfos/CartItemInfos";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemStatus/CartItemStatus";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/CartItemQuantityForm/CartItemQuantityForm";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartItem/MiniCartItem/MiniCartItem";
+@import "~theme/modules/Cart/CartFooter/CartFooter";
-@import "~theme/modules/Cart/ProductItemCart/ProductItemCart";
```

If you have overriden the `theme/components/_components.scss` file and didn't import the `front-commerce/src/web/theme/components/_components.scss` file, you will need to add the new styles for the new components that have been added for the Cart's modules:

```diff
+@import "~theme/components/atoms/Typography/Sku/Sku";
+@import "~theme/components/atoms/Form/Input/NumberInput/NumberInput";
+@import "~theme/components/molecules/Form/FormTitle/FormTitle";
```

### Checkout refactoring

The checkout was already pretty clean. Since it is a crucial part of any e-commerce application, we invested in it to make it a good default.

However, the Address components were a bit confusing in the Checkout because these were used in the Account too. To make it clearer for integrators, we've moved the generic Address components to `theme/modules/User/Address`. This means that in this folder you will now find:

* Address components (previously in `theme/components/molecules/Address`) to display an address in different formats
* Forms components (previously in `theme/modules/Checkout/Address`) to create, edit or remove an address
* EditableAddress  (previously in `theme/modules/Checkout/Address`) that lets you display an Address and lets the User edit and Address if they need to

<details>
<summary>List of the changed translations regarding the Address components</summary>
<ul>
  <li>modules.Checkout.Address.ExistingAddress.addNewAddress</li>
  <li>modules.Checkout.Address.ExistingAddress.editSuccess</li>
  <li>modules.Checkout.Address.NewAddress.shippingAddress</li>

  <li>modules.User.Address.AddressForm.useAsDefaultShipping.label</li>
  <li>modules.User.Address.EditableAddress.edit</li>
</ul>
</details>

#### Styles

If you have overriden the `theme/modules/_modules.scss` file and didn't import the `front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/_modules.scss` file, you will need to add the new styles for the Cart:

```diff

-@import "~theme/modules/User/Address/AddressRemover/AddressRemover";
+@import "~theme/modules/User/Address/AddressForm/RemoveAddressForm/RemoveAddressForm";
```
