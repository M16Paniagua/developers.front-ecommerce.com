## License

One can start working with Front-Commerce on a project as soon as a valid
license has been contracted.

Support and software updates (new features, bugfixes, new integrations…) are
included in the license fees — of course — but the most important is that you’ll
be a customer. And we deeply care about our customers! **Prioritizing features
is tough and we have a lot of ideas and things on our backlog.** We are focusing
on delivering what is needed for our customers in priority, so you can ship your
online store on time.

**As a customer**, you will be able to have direct access to our team and open
support ticket for features requests or technology improvements and have an
impact. Do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com) if
there is something critical for your project that we do not have implemented
yet. We will be transparent and honest with you and tell if we think we could be
delivering what you need on time for your project… **it is maybe being worked on
by our team or asked by another person right now!**

**As a developer or agency**, you can also become a **Partner** and help us with our
mission while being prepared for the future of e-commerce. We are
looking to work with close partners and build a rich ecosystem with different
domains: digital agencies, microservices addicts, Magento agencies, accessibility experts, e-commerce consultants, … you?

We need partners who believe in our mission and our product, to get more
feedback about our choices and widespread the adoption of Front-Commerce.
Interested? Please [contact us](mailto:contact@front-commerce.com).
