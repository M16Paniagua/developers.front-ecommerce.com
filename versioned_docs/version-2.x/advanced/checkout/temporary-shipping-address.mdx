title: Temporary shipping address
description:
  By default, Front-Commerce theme manages shipping addresses in the customer
  account address book. However, it is still possible to manage shipping
  addresses that will not be saved in the address book.

## Classic checkout

You can test these queries in the
[GraphQL Playground](/docs/2.x/magento2/add-new-attribute#discover-the-playground)

This example set an address in customer's address book as the shipping address:

```graphql
mutation {
  setCheckoutShippingInformation(
    cartId: "189"
    shippingMethod: { carrier_code: "flatrate", method_code: "flatrate" }
    shippingAddress: { id: 12 }
  ) {
    success
  }
}
```

This example set a shipping address that will not be saved in the address book:

```graphql
mutation {
  setCheckoutShippingInformation(
    cartId: "209"
    shippingMethod: { carrier_code: "flatrate", method_code: "flatrate" }
    shippingAddress: {
      address: {
        firstname: "Testing"
        lastname: "Front-Commerce"
        street: ["42 Street of test"]
        postcode: "31000"
        city: "Toulouse"
        country_id: "FR"
      }
    }
  ) {
    success
    errorMessage
  }
}
```

To achieve this, you will need to remove the check for addresses ids for logged
in customers in the `web/theme/pages/Checkout/stepsDefinition.js`:

```diff title="web/theme/pages/Checkout/stepDefinitions.js"
const steps = [
  {
    renderProgressItem: () =>
      renderProgressItem("address", "user", messages.address),
    renderStep: (props) => (
      <Address
        checkoutType={props.checkoutState.checkoutType}
        isEditingBillingAddress={props.checkoutState.isEditingBillingAddress}
        isEditingShippingAddress={props.checkoutState.isEditingShippingAddress}
        initialAddress={{
          billing: props.checkoutState.billingAddress,
          shipping: props.checkoutState.shippingAddress,
        }}
        onChooseAddress={(billing, shipping, email) => {
          props.checkoutTransaction(() => {
            props.setEmail(email);
            props.setBillingAddress(billing);
            if (shipping) {
              props.setShippingAddress(shipping);
            }
          });
        }}
        shouldAskShipping={props.checkoutState.isShippable ?? true}
      />
    ),
    isValid: (checkoutState) => {
-      const isValidAddress = (address) =>
-        checkoutState.checkoutType === ACCOUNT_TYPE.GUEST
-          ? address
-          : address?.id;
      const hasGuestInfo =
        checkoutState.checkoutType !== ACCOUNT_TYPE.GUEST ||
        checkoutState.email;

      return (
        isValidAddress(checkoutState.billingAddress) &&
        (!checkoutState.isShippable ||
-          isValidAddress(checkoutState.shippingAddress)) &&
        hasGuestInfo
      );
    },
    isRelevant: () => true,
    isDisplayable: () => true,
  },
```

You must be sure to pass a shipping address without ID to the
`ChooseShippingMethod` component in the `stepsDefinition.js` file by editing the
`Address` component that handle address selection.

```jsx title="web/theme/pages/Checkout/stepDefinitions.js"
<ChooseShippingMethod
  // highlight-start
  // On the line below, if an address has an id, it will use id in address book
  // if not it will use the temporary address
  shippingAddress={props.checkoutState.shippingAddress}
  // highlight-end
  billingAddress={props.checkoutState.billingAddress}
  setShippingAddress={props.setShippingAddress}
  setBillingAddress={props.setBillingAddress}
  initialShipping={{
    shippingMethod: props.checkoutState.shippingMethod,
    shippingAdditionalInfo: props.checkoutState.shippingAdditionalInfo,
  }}
  onChooseShippingMethod={(method) => {
    const { additionalData, ...rest } = method;
    props.checkoutTransaction(() => {
      props.setShippingMethod(rest);
      props.setShippingAdditionalInfo(additionalData || {});
    });
  }}
  onChangeShippingAddress={() => props.gotoStepNumber(0)}
/>
```
