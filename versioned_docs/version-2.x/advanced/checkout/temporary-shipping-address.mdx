title: Temporary shipping address
description:
  By default, Front-Commerce theme manages shipping addresses in the customer
  account address book. However, it is still possible to manage shipping
  addresses that will not be saved in the address book.

This feature is only available for Magento1 and Magento2 classic checkout.

## Classic checkout

You can test these queries in the
[GraphQL Playground](/docs/2.x/magento2/add-new-attribute#discover-the-playground)

This example set an address in customer's address book as the shipping address:

```graphql
mutation {
  setCheckoutShippingInformation(
    cartId: "189"
    shippingMethod: { carrier_code: "flatrate", method_code: "flatrate" }
    shippingAddress: { id: 12 }
  ) {
    success
  }
}
```

This example set a shipping address that will not be saved in the address book:

```graphql
mutation {
  setCheckoutShippingInformation(
    cartId: "209"
    shippingMethod: { carrier_code: "flatrate", method_code: "flatrate" }
    shippingAddress: {
      address: {
        firstname: "Testing"
        lastname: "Front-Commerce"
        street: ["42 Street of test"]
        postcode: "31000"
        city: "Toulouse"
        country_id: "FR"
      }
    }
  ) {
    success
    errorMessage
  }
}
```

To achieve this, you will need to remove the check for addresses ids for logged
in customers in the `web/theme/pages/Checkout/stepsDefinition.js`:

```diff title="web/theme/pages/Checkout/stepDefinitions.js"
const steps = [
  {
    renderProgressItem: () =>
      renderProgressItem("address", "user", messages.address),
    renderStep: (props) => (
      <Address
        checkoutType={props.checkoutState.checkoutType}
        isEditingBillingAddress={props.checkoutState.isEditingBillingAddress}
        isEditingShippingAddress={props.checkoutState.isEditingShippingAddress}
        initialAddress={{
          billing: props.checkoutState.billingAddress,
          shipping: props.checkoutState.shippingAddress,
        }}
        onChooseAddress={(billing, shipping, email) => {
          props.checkoutTransaction(() => {
            props.setEmail(email);
            props.setBillingAddress(billing);
            if (shipping) {
              props.setShippingAddress(shipping);
            }
          });
        }}
        shouldAskShipping={props.checkoutState.isShippable ?? true}
      />
    ),
    isValid: (checkoutState) => {
-      const isValidAddress = (address) =>
-        checkoutState.checkoutType === ACCOUNT_TYPE.GUEST
-          ? address
-          : address?.id;
      const hasGuestInfo =
        checkoutState.checkoutType !== ACCOUNT_TYPE.GUEST ||
        checkoutState.email;

      return (
        isValidAddress(checkoutState.billingAddress) &&
        (!checkoutState.isShippable ||
-          isValidAddress(checkoutState.shippingAddress)) &&
        hasGuestInfo
      );
    },
    isRelevant: () => true,
    isDisplayable: () => true,
  },
```

You must be sure to pass a shipping address without ID to the
`ChooseShippingMethod` component in the `stepsDefinition.js` file by editing the
`Address` component that handle address selection.

```jsx title="web/theme/pages/Checkout/stepDefinitions.js"
<ChooseShippingMethod
  // highlight-start
  // On the line below, if an address has an id, it will use id in address book
  // if not it will use the temporary address
  shippingAddress={props.checkoutState.shippingAddress}
  // highlight-end
  billingAddress={props.checkoutState.billingAddress}
  setShippingAddress={props.setShippingAddress}
  setBillingAddress={props.setBillingAddress}
  initialShipping={{
    shippingMethod: props.checkoutState.shippingMethod,
    shippingAdditionalInfo: props.checkoutState.shippingAdditionalInfo,
  }}
  onChooseShippingMethod={(method) => {
    const { additionalData, ...rest } = method;
    props.checkoutTransaction(() => {
      props.setShippingMethod(rest);
      props.setShippingAdditionalInfo(additionalData || {});
    });
  }}
  onChangeShippingAddress={() => props.gotoStepNumber(0)}
/>
```

## Nagociable quote checkout

You need to override the `EnhanceAddress` enhancer. And on set checkout shipping
address, you must add an input to the mutation to specify if you need to save or
not the address. It's original location is :
`modules/front-commerce-b2b2/web/theme/modules/Checkout/NegotiableQuotes/Address/EnhanceAddress.js`

```diff title="web/theme/modules/Checkout/NegotiableQuotes/Address/EnhanceAddress.js"
 makeCommandDispatcher({
      setShippingAddress:
        (props) =>
        ({ address, onSuccess }) => {
          return {
            options: {
              mutation: SetNegotiableQuoteShippingAddressMutation,
              variables: {
                input: {
                  quoteId: props.negotiableQuoteId,
                  address: formatCheckoutAddressInput(address),
+                 saveInAddressBook: true
                },
              },
            },
```

In the same file, you will find in the `withHandlers` property the
`onChooseAddress` method that will call the `setShippingAddress` mutation, you
can insert your logic here to tell if you need to save address or not

```js
    withHandlers({
      onChooseAddress: (props) => (billing, shipping) => {
```
