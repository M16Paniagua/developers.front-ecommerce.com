# Maintenance Mode

You may want to put one or more of your stores in maintenance mode while you do
some maintenance work/deployment tasks on your store(s).

Front-Commerce comes with an API that allows you to put/remove a store in
maintenance mode. To enable the maintenance mode API you need to set the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN` environment variable.

```shell title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=a-secret-token
```

Once you have setup the `FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN`
environment variable the maintenance mode API will be available after restarting
the server

## The Maintenance Mode API

### Activating the maintenance mode

To activate the maintenance mode on a store which URL is `https://example.com/`
use the following HTTP request:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://example.com/maintenance-mode' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "token": "a-secret-token"
}'
```

The `token` value must match the secret defined in your application's
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN` environment variable.

If your store base URL is `https://example.com/en` the URL would be
`https://example.com/en/maintenance-mode`.

It is also possible to set a duration (in milliseconds) after which the
maintenance mode will be automatically reset:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://example.com/maintenance-mode' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "token": "a-secret-token",
    "duration": 3600000
}'
```

Use this if you have a rough idea of how much time the maintenance task would
take or to prevent a user or automated process to forget to deactivate the
maintenance mode.

### Deactivating the maintenance mode

To deactivate the maintenance mode use the following HTTP request:

```shell
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://example.com/maintenance-mode' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "token": "a-secret-token"
}'
```

### To check the maintenance mode

To check the maintenance mode use the following HTTP request:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://example.com/maintenance-mode'
```

## Bypassing the maintenance mode

To bypass the maintenance mode for certain IP addresses you can configure the
`FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZED_IPS` environment variable. Please
note that you can have multiple IPs separated by a comma like:

```shell title=".env"
FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=a-secret-token
FRONT_COMMERCE_MAINTENANCE_MODE_AUTHORIZED_IPS=127.0.0.1,83.65.12.111,2ce8:c427::7156:ad8e
```

:::caution

Please configure **both v4 and v6** IP as much as possible. You can retrieve
your own IP addresses with https://www.whatismyip.com/
