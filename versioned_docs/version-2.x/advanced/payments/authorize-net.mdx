<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

Authorize.net is a payment gateway service that allows customers to securely
make online payments. It provides a seamless integration for processing credit
card transactions.

## Magento1 (OpenMage LTS)

<SinceVersion tag="2.26" />

### Prerequisites

This feature is directly provided by Magento (OpenMage LTS), but requires the
Front-Commerce Magento module in version >=
[1.5.0](https://gitlab.blackswift.cloud/front-commerce/magento1-module-front-commerce/-/releases/1.5.0).

### Enable Authorize.net in Magento

:::note

This feature is directly provided by Magento (OpenMage LTS). Since documentation
is sparse nowadays on internet, we provide an example that worked for us and our
customers. In case of doubt don't hesitate to contact us and Authorize.net
support.

:::

Go to the
`System > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods > Authorize.net (Deprecated)`
admin section and configure it after your requirements. Ensure that **Enabled =
Yes**, so it appears in the payment list in your Front-Commerce checkout.

If you already process payments with Authorize.net, the configuration should
work without any changes.

### Register the `AuthorizeNetForm` component in Front-Commerce

1. Override the file that lets you register additional payments components in
   Front-Commerce

   ```shell
   mkdir -p my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/
   cp -u node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js
   ```

1. Register the component `AuthorizeNetForm` to be used for `authorizenet`
   payments in `getAdditionalDataComponent.js`

   ```diff title='my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js'
   -const ComponentMap = {};
   +import AuthorizeNetForm from "./AuthorizeNetForm";

   +const ComponentMap = {
   + authorizenet: AuthorizeNetForm,
   +};

   const getAdditionalDataComponent = (method) => {
    return ComponentMap[method.code];
   ```

### Restart Front-Commerce and test

After having **restarted Front-Commerce**, you should be able to use this
payment method when available.

You can find **Test cards** on
[Authorize.net documentation](https://developer.authorize.net/hello_world/testing_guide.html).
