<p>{frontMatter.description}</p>

Payment on account is a payment method for B2B contexts. It allows companies to
make place orders using the credit limit that is specified in their profile.
There is only one way to accept such payments in your Front-Commerce application
for now.

## Magento2 B2B

<SinceVersion tag="2.11" />

### Enable Payment on account

:::note

This feature is directly provided by Adobe Commerce. Please refer to
[the corresponding documentation page to properly configure it on Magento side](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/payment/payment-on-account.html).

:::

In addition, this feature is also controlled by the roles and the associated
permissions assigned to a user within the company. For now, those roles can only
be set programmtically or through the Magento frontend. In local environments, to make sure a company user can use the
_Payment on account_ method you need to:

1. login as the administrator of the company or as a user having the _Manage
   roles and permissions_ permission.
1. go to `https://magento-front.example.com/company/role/`
1. for the role assigned to the user, check the permissions _Sales / Allow
   Checkout / Use Pay On Account method_ and _Company Credit / View_

#### Enable the B2B module

First, you need to
[enable and integrate the Front-Commerce B2B module for Magento2](/docs/2.x/magento2/b2b#enable-b2b-support).

#### Register the Payment on account payment component

1. Override the file that lets you register additional payments components in
   Front-Commerce

   ```shell
   mkdir -p my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/
   cp -u node_modules/front-commerce/src/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js
   ```

1. Register the component `PaymentOnAccount` to be used for `companycredit`
   payments in `getAdditionalDataComponent.js`

   ```diff title='my-module/web/theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/getAdditionalDataComponent.js'
   +import PaymentOnAccount from "theme/modules/Checkout/Payment/AdditionalPaymentInformation/PaymentOnAccount";

   const ComponentMap = {
   +  companycredit: PaymentOnAccount,
   };
   ```

And that's it. After having restarted Front-Commerce, a company customer having
_Payment on account_ enabled should be able to use this payment method.
