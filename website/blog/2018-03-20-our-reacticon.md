title: Our Reacticon
---

A few days ago we attended [Reacticon](http://reacticon.org/), the first conference
about PWAs in the Magento ecosystem.

It was composed of one day of conferences and another one of code! Here are our key
takeaways.

<!--truncate-->

## A friendly community

First of all, we wanted to thank every attendees, speakers and of course organizers
for the atmosphere during the conference.

Everyone was keen to share insights and answer questions, which led to very interesting
discussions.

## PWA is the term used for different things (J)

PWA was the keyword for this event. What quickly came out is that everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it efficiently, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it!

As you may have already heard before, for now there are very few uses of PWAs in
this ecosystem yet.

Magento’s PWA Studio is still being built so there is not much to see yet, Deity
has only « demo features » (such as Add to home screen), Vue Storefront more offline
usage but will need tweaking depending on the store requirements

In discussions what came out was the urgency of getting rid of the current Magento
frontend stack (UI components, Knockout, requireJS).

Big up to Shane.

## Magento Research is promising

One of the best thing that happened to Magento these past few years.
Nice surprise for us.

Anyone who saw James and Andrew in the same room at the same time will
understand.

PWA Studio has just started

Few things public for now, internal experimentations so stay tuned.
We will write future blog posts to help you understand what it is all
about and what to expect.

Spoiler Alert: Front-Commerce will play nicely with what is planned!

## What concerns the community (P)

* Extension Developers are worried. Homogeneize things across solutions. We discussed with a few of them
* Developers would like a minimal stable implementation ASAP Worried about perfectionism related to PWA features, and seem to
  be ok with a working SPA instead

## Front-Commerce (P)

We could demo some of our internal parts to people. Feedbacks.
Live coding improvised to show GraphQL extension custom modules.

Contributed to the PWA Studio by trying it out and writing feedbacks

* PR and 2 PRs on the Deity demo app.

A great opportunity to do some user testing for this website, and our
styleguide. Thank you for your time and feedbacks!

V1.0 is on its way and trust us, you’ll like it.

See you at Reacticon 2.0
